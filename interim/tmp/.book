Then it dawned upon me with a certain\nsuddenness that I was different from the others; or like, mayhap, in\nheart and life and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast\nveil.  I had thereafter no desire to tear down that veil, to creep\nthrough; I held all beyond it in common contempt, and lived above it in\na region of blue sky and great wandering shadows.  That sky was bluest\nwhen I could beat my mates at examination-time, or beat them at a\nfoot-race, or even beat their stringy heads.  Alas, with the years all\nthis fine contempt began to fade; for the words I longed for, and all\ntheir dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine.

In song and exhortation swelled one refrain--Liberty; in\nhis tears and curses the God he implored had Freedom in his right hand.\nAt last it came,--suddenly, fearfully, like a dream.

As the time flew,\nhowever, he began to grasp a new idea.  The ideal of liberty demanded\nfor its attainment powerful means, and these the Fifteenth Amendment\ngave him.  The ballot, which before he had looked upon as a visible\nsign of freedom, he now</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">regarded as the chief means of gaining and\nperfecting the liberty with which war had partially endowed him.  And\nwhy not?  Had not votes made war and emancipated millions?  Had not\nvotes enfranchised the freedmen?  Was anything impossible to a power\nthat had done all this?  A million black men started with renewed zeal\nto vote themselves into the kingdom.  So the decade flew away, the\nrevolution of 1876 came, and left the half-free serf weary, wondering,\nbut still inspired.  Slowly but steadily, in the following years, a new\nvision began gradually to replace the dream of political power,--a\npowerful movement, the rise of another ideal to guide the unguided,\nanother pillar of fire by night after a clouded day.  It was the ideal\nof \"book-learning\"; the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to\nknow and test the power of the cabalistic letters of the white man, the\nlonging to know.  Here at last seemed to have been discovered the\nmountain path to Canaan; longer than</p>",

It\nwas weary work.  The cold statistician wrote down the inches of\nprogress here and there, noted also where here and there a foot had\nslipped or some one had fallen.  To the tired climbers, the horizon was\never dark, the mists were often cold, the Canaan was always dim and far\naway.  If, however, the vistas disclosed as yet no goal, no\nresting-place, little but flattery and criticism, the journey at least\ngave leisure for reflection and self-examination; it changed the child\nof Emancipation to the youth with dawning</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">self-consciousness,\nself-realization, self-respect.  In those sombre forests of his\nstriving his own soul rose before him, and he saw himself,--darkly as\nthrough a veil; and yet he saw in himself some faint revelation of his\npower, of his mission.  He began to have a dim feeling that, to attain\nhis place in the world, he must be himself, and not another.  For the\nfirst time he sought to analyze the burden he bore upon his back, that\ndead-weight of social degradation partially masked behind a half-named\nNegro problem.  He felt his poverty; without a cent, without a home,\nwithout land, tools, or savings, he had entered into competition with\nrich, landed, skilled neighbors.  To be a poor man is hard, but to be a\npoor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships.

  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent\">hands and feet.  Nor\nwas his burden all poverty and ignorance.  The red stain of bastardy,\nwhich two centuries of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had\nstamped upon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African\nchastity, but also the hereditary weight of a mass of corruption from\nwhite adulterers, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">A people thus handicapped ought not to be asked to race with the world,\nbut rather allowed to give all its time and thought to its own social\nproblems.

Men call the shadow\nprejudice, and learnedly explain it as the natural defence of culture\nagainst barbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime,\nthe \"higher\" against the \"lower\" races.

  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent\">contempt\nand hate.  Whisperings and portents came home upon the four winds: Lo!\nwe are diseased and dying, cried the dark hosts; we cannot write, our\nvoting is vain; what need of education, since we must always cook and\nserve?  And the Nation echoed and enforced this self-criticism, saying:\nBe content to be servants, and nothing more; what need of higher\nculture for half-men?  Away with the black man's ballot, by force or\nfraud,--and behold the suicide of a race!

No, not that, but each alone was over-simple\nand incomplete,--the dreams of a credulous race-childhood, or the fond\nimaginings of the other world which does not know and does not want to\nknow our power.

  "page-37": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">sooner had the armies, East and West,\npenetrated Virginia and Tennessee than fugitive slaves appeared within\ntheir lines.  They came at night, when the flickering camp-fires shone\nlike vast unsteady stars along the black horizon: old men and thin,\nwith gray and tufted hair; women with frightened eyes, dragging\nwhimpering hungry children; men and girls, stalwart and gaunt,--a horde\nof starving vagabonds, homeless, helpless, and pitiable, in their dark\ndistress.  Two methods of treating these newcomers seemed equally\nlogical to opposite sorts of minds.  Ben Butler, in Virginia, quickly\ndeclared slave property contraband of war, and put the fugitives to\nwork; while Fremont, in Missouri, declared the slaves free under\nmartial law.  Butler's action was approved, but Fremont's was hastily\ncountermanded, and his successor, Halleck, saw things differently.\n\"Hereafter,\" he commanded, \"no slaves should be allowed to come into\nyour lines at all; if any</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent\">come without your knowledge, when owners call\nfor them deliver them.\"  Such a policy was difficult to enforce; some\nof the black refugees declared themselves freemen, others showed that\ntheir masters had deserted them, and still others were captured with\nforts and plantations.  Evidently, too, slaves were a source of\nstrength to the Confederacy, and were being used as laborers and\nproducers.  \"They constitute a military resource,\" wrote Secretary\nCameron, late in 1861; \"and being such, that they should not be turned\nover to the enemy is too plain to discuss.\"  So gradually the tone of\nthe army chiefs changed; Congress forbade the rendition of fugitives,\nand Butler's \"contrabands\" were welcomed as military laborers.

  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent\">who sat in the White\nHouse saw the inevitable, and emancipated the slaves of rebels on New\nYear's, 1863.  A month later Congress called earnestly for the Negro\nsoldiers whom the act of July, 1862, had half grudgingly allowed to\nenlist.  Thus the barriers were levelled and the deed was done.

Before his experiment was\nbarely started, however, the problem of the fugitives had assumed such\nproportions that it was taken from the hands of the over-burdened\nTreasury Department and given to the army officials.

The government and benevolent societies furnished the means of\ncultivation, and the Negro turned again slowly to work.

Most of the army officers greeted this as a\nwelcome relief from perplexing \"Negro affairs,\" and Secretary\nFessenden, July 29, 1864, issued an excellent system of regulations,\nwhich were afterward closely followed by General Howard.

The debates\nwandered over the whole policy of the administration and the general\nquestion of slavery, without touching very closely the specific merits\nof the measure in hand.  Then the national election took place; and the\nadministration, with a vote of renewed confidence from the country,\naddressed itself to the matter more seriously.  A conference between\nthe two branches of Congress agreed upon a carefully drawn measure\nwhich contained the chief provisions of Sumner's bill, but made the\nproposed organization a department independent of both the War and the\nTreasury officials.  The bill was conservative, giving the new\ndepartment \"general superintendence of all</p>",
  "page-48": "<p class=\"no-indent\">freedmen.\"  Its purpose was\nto \"establish regulations\" for them, protect them, lease them lands,\nadjust their wages, and appear in civil and military courts as their\n\"next friend.\" There were many limitations attached to the powers thus\ngranted, and the organization was made permanent.  Nevertheless, the\nSenate defeated the bill, and a new conference committee was appointed.\nThis committee reported a new bill, February 28, which was whirled\nthrough just as the session closed, and became the act of 1865\nestablishing in the War Department a \"Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and\nAbandoned Lands.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">This last compromise was a hasty bit of legislation, vague and\nuncertain in outline.

  "page-49": "<p class=\"no-indent\">freedmen,\" under \"such\nrules and regulations as may be presented by the head of the Bureau and\napproved by the President.\"  A Commissioner, appointed by the President\nand Senate, was to control the Bureau, with an office force not\nexceeding ten clerks.  The President might also appoint assistant\ncommissioners in the seceded States, and to all these offices military\nofficials might be detailed at regular pay.

Forthwith nine assistant commissioners were appointed.  They\nwere to hasten to their fields of work; seek gradually to close relief\nestablishments, and make the destitute self-supporting; act as courts\nof law where there were no courts, or where Negroes were not recognized\nin them as free; establish the institution of marriage among ex-slaves,\nand keep records; see that freedmen were free to choose their\nemployers, and help in making fair contracts for them; and finally, the\ncircular said:</p>",

It had long been\nthe more or less definitely expressed theory of the North that all the\nchief problems of Emancipation might be settled by establishing the\nslaves on the forfeited lands of their masters,--a sort of poetic\njustice, said some.  But this poetry done into solemn prose meant\neither wholesale confiscation of private property in the South, or vast\nappropriations.  Now Congress had not appropriated a</p>",
  "page-54": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">cent, and no\nsooner did the proclamations of general amnesty appear than the eight\nhundred thousand acres of abandoned lands in the hands of the\nFreedmen's Bureau melted quickly away.  The second difficulty lay in\nperfecting the local organization of the Bureau throughout the wide\nfield of work.  Making a new machine and sending out officials of duly\nascertained fitness for a great work of social reform is no child's\ntask; but this task was even harder, for a new central organization had\nto be fitted on a heterogeneous and confused but already existing\nsystem of relief and control of ex-slaves; and the agents available for\nthis work must be sought for in an army still busy with war\noperations,--men in the very nature of the case ill fitted for delicate\nsocial work,--or among the questionable camp followers of an invading\nhost.  Thus, after a year's work, vigorously as it was pushed, the\nproblem looked even more difficult to grasp and solve than at</p>",
  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent\">the\nbeginning.  Nevertheless, three things that year's work did, well worth\nthe doing: it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it\ntransported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the\nfarm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England\nschoolma'am.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The annals of this Ninth Crusade are yet to be written,--the tale of a\nmission that seemed to our age far more quixotic than the quest of St.\nLouis seemed to his.

Rich and poor they\nwere, serious and curious.  Bereaved now of a father, now of a brother,\nnow of more than these, they came seeking a life work in planting New\nEngland schoolhouses among the white and black of the South.  They did\ntheir work well.  In that first year they taught one hundred thousand\nsouls,</p>",
  "page-56": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and more.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Evidently, Congress must soon legislate again on the hastily organized\nBureau, which had so quickly grown into wide significance and vast\npossibilities.  An institution such as that was well-nigh as difficult\nto end as to begin.  Early in 1866 Congress took up the matter, when\nSenator Trumbull, of Illinois, introduced a bill to extend the Bureau\nand enlarge its powers.  This measure received, at the hands of\nCongress, far more thorough discussion and attention than its\npredecessor.  The war cloud had thinned enough to allow a clearer\nconception of the work of Emancipation.  The champions of the bill\nargued that the strengthening of the Freedmen's Bureau was still a\nmilitary necessity; that it was needed for the proper carrying out of\nthe Thirteenth Amendment, and was a work of sheer justice to the\nex-slave, at a trifling cost to the government.  The opponents of the\nmeasure declared that the war was</p>",
  "page-57": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">over, and the necessity for war\nmeasures past; that the Bureau, by reason of its extraordinary powers,\nwas clearly unconstitutional in time of peace, and was destined to\nirritate the South and pauperize the freedmen, at a final cost of\npossibly hundreds of millions.  These two arguments were unanswered,\nand indeed unanswerable: the one that the extraordinary powers of the\nBureau threatened the civil rights of all citizens; and the other that\nthe government must have power to do what manifestly must be done, and\nthat present abandonment of the freedmen meant their practical\nreenslavement.  The bill which finally passed enlarged and made\npermanent the Freedmen's Bureau.  It was promptly vetoed by President\nJohnson as \"unconstitutional,\" \"unnecessary,\" and \"extrajudicial,\" and\nfailed of passage over the veto.  Meantime, however, the breach between\nCongress and the President began to broaden, and a modified form of the\nlost bill was</p>",
  "page-58": "<p class=\"no-indent\">finally passed over the President's second veto, July 16.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The act of 1866 gave the Freedmen's Bureau its final form,--the form by\nwhich it will be known to posterity and judged of men.  It extended the\nexistence of the Bureau to July, 1868; it authorized additional\nassistant commissioners, the retention of army officers mustered out of\nregular service, the sale of certain forfeited lands to freedmen on\nnominal terms, the sale of Confederate public property for Negro\nschools, and a wider field of judicial interpretation and cognizance.\nThe government of the unreconstructed South was thus put very largely\nin the hands of the Freedmen's Bureau, especially as in many cases the\ndepartmental military commander was now made also assistant\ncommissioner.  It was thus that the Freedmen's Bureau became a\nfull-fledged government of men.  It made laws, executed them and\ninterpreted them; it laid and collected taxes, defined and punished\ncrime, maintained and used military force,</p>",
  "page-59": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and dictated such measures\nas it thought necessary and proper for the accomplishment of its varied\nends.  Naturally, all these powers were not exercised continuously nor\nto their fullest extent; and yet, as General Howard has said, \"scarcely\nany subject that has to be legislated upon in civil society failed, at\none time or another, to demand the action of this singular Bureau.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">To understand and criticise intelligently so vast a work, one must not\nforget an instant the drift of things in the later sixties.  Lee had\nsurrendered, Lincoln was dead, and Johnson and Congress were at\nloggerheads; the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted, the Fourteenth\npending, and the Fifteenth declared in force in 1870.  Guerrilla\nraiding, the ever-present flickering after-flame of war, was spending\nits forces against the Negroes, and all the Southern land was awakening\nas from some wild dream to poverty and social revolution. </p>",
  "page-60": "<p class=\"no-indent\">In a time of\nperfect calm, amid willing neighbors and streaming wealth, the social\nuplifting of four million slaves to an assured and self-sustaining\nplace in the body politic and economic would have been a herculean\ntask; but when to the inherent difficulties of so delicate and nice a\nsocial operation were added the spite and hate of conflict, the hell of\nwar; when suspicion and cruelty were rife, and gaunt Hunger wept beside\nBereavement,--in such a case, the work of any instrument of social\nregeneration was in large part foredoomed to failure.  The very name of\nthe Bureau stood for a thing in the South which for two centuries and\nbetter men had refused even to argue,--that life amid free Negroes was\nsimply unthinkable, the maddest of experiments.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The agents that the Bureau could command varied all the way from\nunselfish philanthropists to narrow-minded busybodies and thieves; and\neven though it be true that the average was far better than the worst,\nit was</p>",

And the Negro\nknew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may have been,\nSouthern men had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate this\nslavery under which the black masses, with half-articulate thought, had\nwrithed and shivered.  They welcomed freedom with a cry.  They shrank\nfrom the master who still strove for their chains; they fled to the\nfriends that had freed them, even though those friends stood ready to\nuse them as a club for driving the recalcitrant South back into\nloyalty.  So the cleft</p>",
  "page-62": "<p class=\"no-indent\">between the white and black South grew.  Idle to\nsay it never should have been; it was as inevitable as its results were\npitiable.  Curiously incongruous elements were left arrayed against\neach other,--the North, the government, the carpet-bagger, and the\nslave, here; and there, all the South that was white, whether gentleman\nor vagabond, honest man or rascal, lawless murderer or martyr to duty.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Thus it is doubly difficult to write of this period calmly, so intense\nwas the feeling, so mighty the human passions that swayed and blinded\nmen.  Amid it all, two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming\nages,--the one, a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers had quit\nthemselves like men, whose sons lay in nameless graves; who bowed to\nthe evil of slavery because its abolition threatened untold ill to all;\nwho stood at last, in the evening of life, a blighted, ruined form,\nwith hate in his eyes;--and the other, a form hovering dark</p>",
  "page-63": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and\nmother-like, her awful face black with the mists of centuries, had\naforetime quailed at that white master's command, had bent in love over\nthe cradles of his sons and daughters, and closed in death the sunken\neyes of his wife,--aye, too, at his behest had laid herself low to his\nlust, and borne a tawny man-child to the world, only to see her dark\nboy's limbs scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after\n\"damned Niggers.\"  These were the saddest sights of that woful day; and\nno man clasped the hands of these two passing figures of the\npresent-past; but, hating, they went to their long home, and, hating,\ntheir children's children live today.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Here, then, was the field of work for the Freedmen's Bureau; and since,\nwith some hesitation, it was continued by the act of 1868 until 1869,\nlet us look upon four years of its work as a whole.  There were, in\n1868, nine hundred Bureau officials scattered from Washington to Texas,\nruling, directly and indirectly,</p>",
  "page-64": "<p class=\"no-indent\">many millions of men.  The deeds of\nthese rulers fall mainly under seven heads: the relief of physical\nsuffering, the overseeing of the beginnings of free labor, the buying\nand selling of land, the establishment of schools, the paying of\nbounties, the administration of justice, and the financiering of all\nthese activities.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Up to June, 1869, over half a million patients had been treated by\nBureau physicians and surgeons, and sixty hospitals and asylums had\nbeen in operation.  In fifty months twenty-one million free rations\nwere distributed at a cost of over four million dollars.  Next came the\ndifficult question of labor.  First, thirty thousand black men were\ntransported from the refuges and relief stations back to the farms,\nback to the critical trial of a new way of working.  Plain instructions\nwent out from Washington: the laborers must be free to choose their\nemployers, no fixed rate of wages was prescribed, and there was to be\nno peonage or forced</p>",
  "page-65": "<p class=\"no-indent\">labor.  So far, so good; but where local agents\ndiffered toto caelo in capacity and character, where the personnel was\ncontinually changing, the outcome was necessarily varied.  The largest\nelement of success lay in the fact that the majority of the freedmen\nwere willing, even eager, to work.  So labor contracts were\nwritten,--fifty thousand in a single State,--laborers advised, wages\nguaranteed, and employers supplied.  In truth, the organization became\na vast labor bureau,--not perfect, indeed, notably defective here and\nthere, but on the whole successful beyond the dreams of thoughtful men.\nThe two great obstacles which confronted the officials were the tyrant\nand the idler,--the slaveholder who was determined to perpetuate\nslavery under another name; and, the freedman who regarded freedom as\nperpetual rest,--the Devil and the Deep Sea.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">In the work of establishing the Negroes as peasant proprietors, the\nBureau was from the first handicapped</p>",
  "page-66": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">and at last absolutely checked.\nSomething was done, and larger things were planned; abandoned lands\nwere leased so long as they remained in the hands of the Bureau, and a\ntotal revenue of nearly half a million dollars derived from black\ntenants.  Some other lands to which the nation had gained title were\nsold on easy terms, and public lands were opened for settlement to the\nvery few freedmen who had tools and capital.  But the vision of \"forty\nacres and a mule\"--the righteous and reasonable ambition to become a\nlandholder, which the nation had all but categorically promised the\nfreedmen--was destined in most cases to bitter disappointment.  And\nthose men of marvellous hindsight who are today seeking to preach the\nNegro back to the present peonage of the soil know well, or ought to\nknow, that the opportunity of binding the Negro peasant willingly to\nthe soil was lost on that day when the Commissioner of the Freedmen's\nBureau had to go to South Carolina</p>",
  "page-67": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and tell the weeping freedmen, after\ntheir years of toil, that their land was not theirs, that there was a\nmistake--somewhere.  If by 1874 the Georgia Negro alone owned three\nhundred and fifty thousand acres of land, it was by grace of his thrift\nrather than by bounty of the government.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of\nthe free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary\neducation among all classes in the South.  It not only called the\nschool-mistresses through the benevolent agencies and built them\nschoolhouses, but it helped discover and support such apostles of human\nculture as Edmund Ware, Samuel Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath.  The\nopposition to Negro education in the South was at first bitter, and\nshowed itself in ashes, insult, and blood; for the South believed an\neducated Negro to be a dangerous Negro.  And the South was not wholly\nwrong; for education</p>",
  "page-68": "<p class=\"no-indent\">among all kinds of men always has had, and always\nwill have, an element of danger and revolution, of dissatisfaction and\ndiscontent.  Nevertheless, men strive to know.  Perhaps some inkling of\nthis paradox, even in the unquiet days of the Bureau, helped the\nbayonets allay an opposition to human training which still to-day lies\nsmouldering in the South, but not flaming.  Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and\nHampton were founded in these days, and six million dollars were\nexpended for educational work, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nof which the freedmen themselves gave of their poverty.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Such contributions, together with the buying of land and various other\nenterprises, showed that the ex-slave was handling some free capital\nalready.  The chief initial source of this was labor in the army, and\nhis pay and bounty as a soldier.  Payments to Negro soldiers were at\nfirst complicated by the ignorance of the</p>",
  "page-69": "<p class=\"no-indent\">recipients, and the fact that\nthe quotas of colored regiments from Northern States were largely\nfilled by recruits from the South, unknown to their fellow soldiers.\nConsequently, payments were accompanied by such frauds that Congress,\nby joint resolution in 1867, put the whole matter in the hands of the\nFreedmen's Bureau.  In two years six million dollars was thus\ndistributed to five thousand claimants, and in the end the sum exceeded\neight million dollars.  Even in this system fraud was frequent; but\nstill the work put needed capital in the hands of practical paupers,\nand some, at least, was well spent.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The most perplexing and least successful part of the Bureau's work lay\nin the exercise of its judicial functions.  The regular Bureau court\nconsisted of one representative of the employer, one of the Negro, and\none of the Bureau.  If the Bureau could have maintained a perfectly\njudicial attitude, this arrangement would</p>",
  "page-70": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">have been ideal, and must in\ntime have gained confidence; but the nature of its other activities and\nthe character of its personnel prejudiced the Bureau in favor of the\nblack litigants, and led without doubt to much injustice and annoyance.\nOn the other hand, to leave the Negro in the hands of Southern courts\nwas impossible.  In a distracted land where slavery had hardly fallen,\nto keep the strong from wanton abuse of the weak, and the weak from\ngloating insolently over the half-shorn strength of the strong, was a\nthankless, hopeless task.  The former masters of the land were\nperemptorily ordered about, seized, and imprisoned, and punished over\nand again, with scant courtesy from army officers.  The former slaves\nwere intimidated, beaten, raped, and butchered by angry and revengeful\nmen.  Bureau courts tended to become centres simply for punishing\nwhites, while the regular civil courts tended to become solely\ninstitutions for perpetuating</p>",
  "page-71": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">the slavery of blacks.  Almost every law\nand method ingenuity could devise was employed by the legislatures to\nreduce the Negroes to serfdom,--to make them the slaves of the State,\nif not of individual owners; while the Bureau officials too often were\nfound striving to put the \"bottom rail on top,\" and gave the freedmen a\npower and independence which they could not yet use.  It is all well\nenough for us of another generation to wax wise with advice to those\nwho bore the burden in the heat of the day.  It is full easy now to see\nthat the man who lost home, fortune, and family at a stroke, and saw\nhis land ruled by \"mules and niggers,\" was really benefited by the\npassing of slavery.  It is not difficult now to say to the young\nfreedman, cheated and cuffed about who has seen his father's head\nbeaten to a jelly and his own mother namelessly assaulted, that the\nmeek shall inherit the earth.

Had that\ncontrol been from within, the Negro would have been re-enslaved, to all\nintents and purposes.

In\nsuch a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black man was a\nnecessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race,\nand the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of\nthe war.  Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race\nfeud.

Washington.  It began at\nthe time when war memories and ideals were rapidly passing; a day of\nastonishing commercial development was dawning; a sense of doubt and\nhesitation overtook the freedmen's sons,--then it was that his leading\nbegan.  Mr. Washington came, with a simple definite programme, at the\npsychological moment when the nation was a little ashamed of having\nbestowed so much sentiment on Negroes, and was concentrating its\nenergies on Dollars. </p>",
  "page-84": "<p class=\"no-indent\">His programme of industrial education,\nconciliation of the South, and submission and silence as to civil and\npolitical rights, was not wholly original; the Free Negroes from 1830\nup to war-time had striven to build industrial schools, and the\nAmerican Missionary Association had from the first taught various\ntrades; and Price and others had sought a way of honorable alliance\nwith the best of the Southerners.  But Mr. Washington first\nindissolubly linked these things; he put enthusiasm, unlimited energy,\nand perfect faith into his programme, and changed it from a by-path\ninto a veritable Way of Life.  And the tale of the methods by which he\ndid this is a fascinating study of human life.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It startled the nation to hear a Negro advocating such a programme\nafter many decades of bitter complaint; it startled and won the\napplause of the South, it interested and won the admiration of the\nNorth; and after a confused murmur of protest, it</p>",

The South interpreted it in different ways: the\nradicals received it as a complete surrender of the demand for civil\nand political equality; the conservatives, as a generously conceived\nworking basis for mutual understanding.  So both approved it, and\nto-day its author is certainly the most distinguished Southerner since\nJefferson Davis, and the one with the largest personal following.</p>",
  "page-86": "<p>Next to this achievement comes Mr. Washington's work in gaining place\nand consideration in the North.  Others less shrewd and tactful had\nformerly essayed to sit on these two stools and had fallen between\nthem; but as Mr. Washington knew the heart of the South from birth and\ntraining, so by singular insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of\nthe age which was dominating the North.  And so thoroughly did he learn\nthe speech and thought of triumphant commercialism, and the ideals of\nmaterial prosperity, that the picture of a lone black boy poring over a\nFrench grammar amid the weeds and dirt of a neglected home soon seemed\nto him the acme of absurdities.  One wonders what Socrates and St.\nFrancis of Assisi would say to this.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">And yet this very singleness of vision and thorough oneness with his\nage is a mark of the successful man.

And yet the time is come when one may speak\nin all sincerity and utter courtesy of the mistakes and shortcomings of\nMr. Washington's career, as well as of his triumphs, without being\nthought captious or envious, and without forgetting that it is easier\nto do ill than well in the world.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The criticism that has hitherto met Mr. Washington has not always been\nof this broad character.

In the North the feeling has several times forced\nitself into words, that Mr. Washington's counsels of submission\noverlooked certain elements of true manhood, and that his educational\nprogramme was unnecessarily narrow.  Usually, however, such criticism\nhas not found open expression, although, too, the spiritual sons of the\nAbolitionists have not been prepared to acknowledge that the schools\nfounded before Tuskegee, by men of broad ideals and self-sacrificing\nspirit, were wholly failures or worthy of ridicule.  While, then,\ncriticism has not failed to follow Mr. Washington, yet the prevailing\npublic opinion of the land has been but too willing to</p>",

Some of this opposition is, of course, mere envy; the\ndisappointment of displaced demagogues and the spite of narrow minds.\nBut aside from this, there is among educated and thoughtful colored men\nin all parts of the land a feeling of deep regret, sorrow, and\napprehension at the wide currency and ascendancy which some of Mr.\nWashington's theories have gained.

  "page-92": "<p class=\"no-indent\">to earth and brute is added an environment\nof men and ideas, then the attitude of the imprisoned group may take\nthree main forms,--a feeling of revolt and revenge; an attempt to\nadjust all thought and action to the will of the greater group; or,\nfinally, a determined effort at self-realization and self-development\ndespite environing opinion.  The influence of all of these attitudes at\nvarious times can be traced in the history of the American Negro, and\nin the evolution of his successive leaders.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Before 1750, while the fire of African freedom still burned in the\nveins of the slaves, there was in all leadership or attempted\nleadership but the one motive of revolt and revenge,--typified in the\nterrible Maroons, the Danish blacks, and Cato of Stono, and veiling all\nthe Americas in fear of insurrection.  The liberalizing tendencies of\nthe latter half of the eighteenth century brought, along with kindlier\nrelations between black</p>",

The disappointment and impatience of the\nNegroes at the persistence of slavery and serfdom voiced itself in two\nmovements.  The slaves in the South, aroused undoubtedly by vague\nrumors of the Haytian revolt, made three fierce attempts at\ninsurrection,--in 1800 under Gabriel in Virginia, in 1822 under Vesey\nin Carolina, and in 1831 again in Virginia under the terrible Nat\nTurner.

By 1830 slavery\nseemed hopelessly fastened on the South, and the slaves thoroughly\ncowed into submission.  The free Negroes of the North, inspired by the\nmulatto immigrants from the West Indies, began to change the basis of\ntheir demands; they recognized the slavery of slaves, but insisted that\nthey themselves were freemen, and sought assimilation and amalgamation\nwith the nation on the same terms with other men.  Thus, Forten and\nPurvis of Philadelphia, Shad of Wilmington, Du Bois of New</p>",
  "page-95": "<p class=\"no-indent\">Haven,\nBarbadoes of Boston, and others, strove singly and together as men,\nthey said, not as slaves; as \"people of color,\" not as \"Negroes.\"  The\ntrend of the times, however, refused them recognition save in\nindividual and exceptional cases, considered them as one with all the\ndespised blacks, and they soon found themselves striving to keep even\nthe rights they formerly had of voting and working and moving as\nfreemen.  Schemes of migration and colonization arose among them; but\nthese they refused to entertain, and they eventually turned to the\nAbolition movement as a final refuge.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Here, led by Remond, Nell, Wells-Brown, and Douglass, a new period of\nself-assertion and self-development dawned.  To be sure, ultimate\nfreedom and assimilation was the ideal before the leaders, but the\nassertion of the manhood rights of the Negro by himself was the main\nreliance, and John Brown's raid was the extreme of its logic.  After\nthe war and</p>",
  "page-96": "<p class=\"no-indent\">emancipation, the great form of Frederick Douglass, the\ngreatest of American Negro leaders, still led the host.\nSelf-assertion, especially in political lines, was the main programme,\nand behind Douglass came Elliot, Bruce, and Langston, and the\nReconstruction politicians, and, less conspicuous but of greater social\nsignificance, Alexander Crummell and Bishop Daniel Payne.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Then came the Revolution of 1876, the suppression of the Negro votes,\nthe changing and shifting of ideals, and the seeking of new lights in\nthe great night.  Douglass, in his old age, still bravely stood for the\nideals of his early manhood,--ultimate assimilation through\nself-assertion, and on no other terms.  For a time Price arose as a new\nleader, destined, it seemed, not to give up, but to re-state the old\nideals in a form less repugnant to the white South.  But he passed away\nin his prime.

Washington arose as\nessentially the leader not of one race but of two,--a compromiser\nbetween the South, the North, and the Negro.  Naturally the Negroes\nresented, at first bitterly, signs of compromise which surrendered\ntheir civil and political rights, even though this was to be exchanged\nfor larger chances of economic development.  The rich and dominating\nNorth, however, was not only weary of the race problem, but was\ninvesting largely in Southern enterprises, and welcomed any method of\npeaceful cooperation.  Thus, by national opinion, the Negroes began to\nrecognize Mr. Washington's leadership; and the voice of criticism was\nhushed.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Mr. Washington represents in Negro thought the old attitude of\nadjustment and submission; but adjustment at such a peculiar time as to\nmake his</p>",
  "page-98": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">programme unique.  This is an age of unusual economic\ndevelopment, and Mr. Washington's programme naturally takes an economic\ncast, becoming a gospel of Work and Money to such an extent as\napparently almost completely to overshadow the higher aims of life.\nMoreover, this is an age when the more advanced races are coming in\ncloser contact with the less developed races, and the race-feeling is\ntherefore intensified; and Mr. Washington's programme practically\naccepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races.  Again, in our own\nland, the reaction from the sentiment of war time has given impetus to\nrace-prejudice against Negroes, and Mr. Washington withdraws many of\nthe high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.  In other\nperiods of intensified prejudice all the Negro's tendency to\nself-assertion has been called forth; at this period a policy of\nsubmission is advocated.  In the history of nearly all</p>",

The mother was different,--strong,\nbustling, and energetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an ambition\nto live \"like folks.\" There was a crowd of children.  Two boys had gone\naway.  There remained two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; John,\ntall, awkward, and eighteen; Jim, younger, quicker, and better looking;\nand two babies of indefinite age.

A pale blackboard crouched\nin the corner.  My desk was made of three boards, reinforced at\ncritical points, and my chair, borrowed from the landlady, had to be\nreturned every night.  Seats for the children--these puzzled me much.\nI was haunted by a New England vision of neat little desks and chairs,\nbut, alas! the reality was rough plank benches without backs, and at\ntimes without legs.

I loved my school, and the fine faith the children had\nin the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvellous.  We read and\nspelled together, wrote a little, picked flowers, sang, and listened to\nstories of the world beyond the hill.  At times the school would\ndwindle away, and I would start out.

In the\ntiny back kitchen I was often invited to \"take out and help\" myself to\nfried chicken and wheat biscuit, \"meat\" and corn pone, string-beans and\nberries.  At first I used to be a little alarmed at the approach of\nbedtime in the one lone bedroom, but embarrassment was very deftly\navoided.  First, all the children nodded and slept, and were stowed\naway in one great pile of goose feathers; next, the mother and the\nfather discreetly slipped away to the kitchen while I went to bed;\nthen, blowing out the dim light, they retired in the dark.

Uncle Bird had a small, rough farm, all woods and\nhills, miles from the big road; but he was full of tales,--he preached\nnow and then,--and with his children, berries, horses, and wheat he was\nhappy and prosperous.  Often, to keep the peace, I must go where life\nwas less lovely; for instance, 'Tildy's mother was incorrigibly dirty,\nReuben's larder was limited seriously, and herds of untamed insects\nwandered over the Eddingses' beds.  Best of all I loved to go to\nJosie's, and sit on the porch, eating peaches, while the mother bustled\nand talked: how Josie had bought the sewing-machine; how Josie worked\nat service in winter, but that four dollars a month was \"mighty little\"\nwages; how Josie longed to go away to school, but that it \"looked like\"\nthey never could get far enough ahead to</p>",

There are\nbabies a-plenty, and one half-witted girl.

Some\nof the window-glass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay\nmournfully under the house.  I peeped through the window half\nreverently, and found things that were more familiar.

I felt sure that Ben and 'Tildy would come to\nnaught from such a home.  But this is an odd world; for Ben is a busy\nfarmer in Smith County, \"doing well, too,\" they say, and he had cared\nfor little 'Tildy until last spring, when a lover married her.  A hard\nlife the lad had led, toiling for meat, and laughed at because he was\nhomely and crooked.  There was Sam Carlon, an impudent old skinflint,\nwho had definite notions about \"niggers,\" and hired Ben a summer and\nwould not pay him.

They used to have a certain\nmagnificent barbarism about them that I liked.  They were never vulgar,\nnever immoral, but rather rough and primitive, with an\nunconventionality that spent itself in loud guffaws, slaps on the back,\nand naps in the corner.  I hurried by the cottage of the misborn Neill\nboys.  It was empty, and they were grown into fat, lazy farm-hands.  I\nsaw the home of the Hickmans, but Albert, with his stooping shoulders,\nhad passed from the world.  Then I came to the Burkes' gate and peered\nthrough; the enclosure looked rough and untrimmed, and yet there were\nthe same fences around the old farm save to the left, where lay\ntwenty-five other acres.  And lo! the cabin in the hollow had climbed\nthe hill and swollen to a half-finished six-room cottage.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The Burkes held a hundred acres, but they were still</p>",

Some day he must stop, for his massive\nframe is showing decline.  The mother wore shoes, but the lion-like\nphysique of other days was broken.  The children had grown up.  Rob,\nthe image of his father, was loud and rough with laughter.

We\nwound on down the stream till we came to a gate that I did not\nrecognize, but the boy insisted that it was \"Uncle Bird's.\"  The farm\nwas fat with the growing crop.  In that little valley was a strange\nstillness as I rode up; for death and marriage had stolen youth and\nleft age and childhood there.  We sat and talked that night after the\nchores were done.  Uncle Bird was grayer, and his eyes did not see so\nwell, but he was still jovial.  We talked of the acres bought,--one\nhundred and twenty-five,--of the new guest-chamber added, of Martha's\nmarrying.  Then we talked of death: Fanny and Fred were gone; a shadow\nhung over the other daughter, and when it lifted she was to go to\nNashville to school.

Even the bits which are left are heavily mortgaged,\nand, like the rest of the land, tilled by tenants.  Here is one of them\nnow,--a tall brown man, a hard worker and a hard drinker, illiterate,\nbut versed in farmlore, as his nodding crops declare.

This, then, is the Cotton\nKingdom,--the shadow of a marvellous dream.  And where is the King?\nPerhaps this is he,--the sweating ploughman, tilling his eighty acres\nwith two lean mules, and fighting a hard battle with debt.  So we sit\nmusing, until, as we turn a corner on the sandy road, there comes a\nfairer scene suddenly in view,--a neat cottage snugly ensconced by the\nroad, and near it a little store.

Here is his gin-house with new\nmachinery just installed.  Three hundred bales of cotton went through\nit last year.  Two children he has sent away to school.

The Big House\nstands in half-ruin, its great front door staring blankly at the\nstreet, and the back part grotesquely restored for its black tenant.  A\nshabby, well-built Negro he is, unlucky and irresolute.  He digs hard\nto pay rent to the white girl who owns the remnant of the place.  She\nmarried a policeman, and lives in Savannah.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Now and again we come to churches.  Here is one now,--Shepherd's, they\ncall it,--a great whitewashed barn of a thing, perched on stilts of\nstone, and looking for all the world as though it were just resting\nhere a moment and might be expected to waddle off down the road at\nalmost any time.

The churches vary from log-huts to those\nlike Shepherd's, and the schools from nothing to this little house that\nsits demurely on the county line.  It is a tiny plank-house, perhaps\nten by twenty, and has within a double row of rough unplaned benches,\nresting mostly on legs, sometimes on boxes.  Opposite the door is a\nsquare home-made desk.  In one corner are the ruins of a stove, and in\nthe other a dim blackboard.  It is the cheerfulest schoolhouse I have\nseen in Dougherty, save in town.

  "page-211": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">these sights were pointed out to us by\na kindly old man, black, white-haired, and seventy.  Forty-five years\nhe had lived here, and now supports himself and his old wife by the\nhelp of the steer tethered yonder and the charity of his black\nneighbors.  He shows us the farm of the Hills just across the county\nline in Baker,--a widow and two strapping sons, who raised ten bales\n(one need not add \"cotton\" down here) last year.  There are fences and\npigs and cows, and the soft-voiced, velvet-skinned young Memnon, who\nsauntered half-bashfully over to greet the strangers, is proud of his\nhome.  We turn now to the west along the county line.  Great dismantled\ntrunks of pines tower above the green cottonfields, cracking their\nnaked gnarled fingers toward the border of living forest beyond.  There\nis little beauty in this region, only a sort of crude abandon that\nsuggests power,--a naked grandeur, as it were.  The houses are bare and\nstraight; there are no hammocks or easy-chairs, and few flowers. </p>",

And here are no\nfences.  But now and then the crisscross rails or straight palings\nbreak into view, and then we know a touch of culture is near.  Of\ncourse Harrison Gohagen,--a quiet yellow man, young, smooth-faced, and\ndiligent,--of course he is lord of some hundred acres, and we expect to\nsee a vision of well-kept rooms and fat beds and laughing children.\nFor has he not fine fences?

Only in the cabins appeared now and then a bit\nof lazy life.  I could imagine the place under some weird spell, and\nwas half-minded to search out the princess.  An old ragged black man,\nhonest, simple, and improvident, told us the tale.  The Wizard of the\nNorth--the Capitalist--had rushed down in the seventies to woo this coy\ndark soil.  He bought a square mile or more, and for a time the\nfield-hands sang, the gins groaned, and the mills buzzed.  Then came a\nchange.  The agent's son embezzled the funds and ran off with them.\nThen the agent himself disappeared.  Finally the new agent stole even\nthe books, and the company in wrath closed its business and its</p>",

So the Waters-Loring plantation was stilled by the spell of\ndishonesty, and stands like some gaunt rebuke to a scarred land.</p><p>Somehow that plantation ended our day's journey; for I could not shake\noff the influence of that silent scene.  Back toward town we glided,\npast the straight and thread-like pines, past a dark tree-dotted pond\nwhere the air was heavy with a dead sweet perfume.  White\nslender-legged curlews flitted by us, and the garnet blooms of the\ncotton looked gay against the green and purple stalks.  A peasant girl\nwas hoeing in the field, white-turbaned and black-limbed.  All this we\nsaw, but the spell still lay upon us.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">How curious a land is this,--how full of untold story, of tragedy and\nlaughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic\npast, and big with future promise!

Then comes the pool; pendent gray moss and brackish\nwaters appear, and forests filled with wildfowl.  In one place the wood\nis on fire, smouldering in dull red anger; but nobody minds.  Then the\nswamp grows beautiful; a raised road, built by chained Negro convicts,\ndips down into it, and forms a way walled and almost covered in living\ngreen.  Spreading trees spring from a prodigal luxuriance of\nundergrowth; great dark green shadows fade into the black background,\nuntil all is one mass of tangled semi-tropical foliage, marvellous in\nits weird savage splendor.

Osceola, the Indian-Negro chieftain, had\nrisen in the swamps of Florida, vowing vengeance.  His war-cry reached\nthe red Creeks of Dougherty, and their war-cry rang from the\nChattahoochee to the sea.  Men and women and children fled and fell\nbefore them as they swept into Dougherty.  In yonder shadows a dark and\nhideously painted warrior glided stealthily on,--another and another,\nuntil three hundred had crept into the treacherous swamp.  Then the\nfalse slime closing about them called the white men from the east.\nWaist-deep, they fought beneath the tall trees, until the war-cry was\nhushed and the Indians glided back into the west.

Day after day the songs of the callous, the wail of the\nmotherless, and the muttered curses of the wretched echoed from the\nFlint to the Chickasawhatchee, until by 1860 there had risen in West\nDougherty perhaps the richest slave kingdom the modern world ever knew.\nA hundred and fifty barons commanded the labor of nearly six thousand\nNegroes, held sway over farms with ninety thousand acres tilled land,\nvalued even in times of cheap soil at three millions of dollars.\nTwenty thousand bales of ginned cotton went yearly to England, New and\nOld; and men that came there bankrupt made money and grew rich.  In a\nsingle decade the cotton output increased four-fold and the value of\nlands was tripled.  It was the heyday of the nouveau riche, and a life\nof careless extravagance among the masters.

This plantation, owned now by a foreigner, was a\npart of the famous Bolton estate.  After the war it was for many years\nworked by gangs of Negro convicts,--and black convicts then were even\nmore plentiful than now; it was a way of making Negroes work, and the\nquestion of guilt was a minor one.  Hard tales of cruelty and\nmistreatment of the chained freemen are told, but the county\nauthorities were deaf until the free-labor market was nearly ruined by\nwholesale migration.

The keynote of the Black\nBelt is debt; not commercial credit, but debt in the sense of continued\ninability on the part of the mass of the population to make income\ncover expense.  This is the direct heritage of the South from the\nwasteful economies of the slave regime; but it was emphasized and\nbrought to a crisis by</p>",
  "page-241": "<p class=\"no-indent\">the Emancipation of the slaves.  In 1860,\nDougherty County had six thousand slaves, worth at least two and a half\nmillions of dollars; its farms were estimated at three\nmillions,--making five and a half millions of property, the value of\nwhich depended largely on the slave system, and on the speculative\ndemand for land once marvellously rich but already partially\ndevitalized by careless and exhaustive culture.  The war then meant a\nfinancial crash; in place of the five and a half millions of 1860,\nthere remained in 1870 only farms valued at less than two millions.\nWith this came increased competition in cotton culture from the rich\nlands of Texas; a steady fall in the normal price of cotton followed,\nfrom about fourteen cents a pound in 1860 until it reached four cents\nin 1898.  Such a financial revolution was it that involved the owners\nof the cotton-belt in debt.  And if things went ill with the master,\nhow fared it with the man?</p>",
  "page-242": "<p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The plantations of Dougherty County in slavery days were not as\nimposing and aristocratic as those of Virginia.  The Big House was\nsmaller and usually one-storied, and sat very near the slave cabins.\nSometimes these cabins stretched off on either side like wings;\nsometimes only on one side, forming a double row, or edging the road\nthat turned into the plantation from the main thoroughfare.  The form\nand disposition of the laborers' cabins throughout the Black Belt is\nto-day the same as in slavery days.  Some live in the self-same cabins,\nothers in cabins rebuilt on the sites of the old.  All are sprinkled in\nlittle groups over the face of the land, centering about some\ndilapidated Big House where the head-tenant or agent lives.  The\ngeneral character and arrangement of these dwellings remains on the\nwhole unaltered.  There were in the county, outside the corporate town\nof Albany, about fifteen hundred Negro families in 1898.  Out of all\nthese, only a</p>",

It is nearly always old and bare,\nbuilt of rough boards, and neither plastered nor ceiled.  Light and\nventilation are supplied by the single door and by the square hole in\nthe wall with its wooden shutter.  There is no glass, porch, or\nornamentation without.  Within is a fireplace, black and smoky, and\nusually unsteady with age.  A bed or two, a table, a wooden chest, and\na few chairs compose the furniture; while a stray show-bill or</p>",
  "page-244": "<p class=\"no-indent\">a\nnewspaper makes up the decorations for the walls.  Now and then one may\nfind such a cabin kept scrupulously neat, with merry steaming\nfireplaces and hospitable door; but the majority are dirty and\ndilapidated, smelling of eating and sleeping, poorly ventilated, and\nanything but homes.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Above all, the cabins are crowded.  We have come to associate crowding\nwith homes in cities almost exclusively.  This is primarily because we\nhave so little accurate knowledge of country life.  Here in Dougherty\nCounty one may find families of eight and ten occupying one or two\nrooms, and for every ten rooms of house accommodation for the Negroes\nthere are twenty-five persons.  The worst tenement abominations of New\nYork do not have above twenty-two persons for every ten rooms.  Of\ncourse, one small, close room in a city, without a yard, is in many\nrespects worse than the larger single country room.  In other respects\nit is better;</p>",

The single great advantage of the Negro peasant is that he may\nspend most of his life outside his hovel, in the open fields.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">There are four chief causes of these wretched homes: First, long custom\nborn of slavery has assigned such homes to Negroes; white laborers\nwould be offered better accommodations, and might, for that and similar\nreasons, give better work.  Secondly, the Negroes, used to such\naccommodations, do not as a rule demand better; they do not know what\nbetter houses mean.  Thirdly, the landlords as a class have not yet\ncome to realize that it is a good business investment to raise the\nstandard of living among labor by slow and judicious methods; that a\nNegro laborer who demands three rooms and fifty cents a day would give\nmore efficient work and leave a larger profit than a discouraged toiler\nherding his family in one room and working for thirty</p>",
  "page-246": "<p class=\"no-indent\">cents.  Lastly,\namong such conditions of life there are few incentives to make the\nlaborer become a better farmer.  If he is ambitious, he moves to town\nor tries other labor; as a tenant-farmer his outlook is almost\nhopeless, and following it as a makeshift, he takes the house that is\ngiven him without protest.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">In such homes, then, these Negro peasants live.  The families are both\nsmall and large; there are many single tenants,--widows and bachelors,\nand remnants of broken groups.  The system of labor and the size of the\nhouses both tend to the breaking up of family groups: the grown\nchildren go away as contract hands or migrate to town, the sister goes\ninto service; and so one finds many families with hosts of babies, and\nmany newly married couples, but comparatively few families with\nhalf-grown and grown sons and daughters.  The average size of Negro\nfamilies has undoubtedly decreased since the war, primarily from\neconomic stress. </p>",
  "page-247": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">In Russia over a third of the bridegrooms and over\nhalf the brides are under twenty; the same was true of the antebellum\nNegroes.  Today, however, very few of the boys and less than a fifth of\nthe Negro girls under twenty are married.  The young men marry between\nthe ages of twenty-five and thirty-five; the young women between twenty\nand thirty.  Such postponement is due to the difficulty of earning\nsufficient to rear and support a family; and it undoubtedly leads, in\nthe country districts, to sexual immorality.  The form of this\nimmorality, however, is very seldom that of prostitution, and less\nfrequently that of illegitimacy than one would imagine.  Rather, it\ntakes the form of separation and desertion after a family group has\nbeen formed.  The number of separated persons is thirty-five to the\nthousand,--a very large number.  It would of course be unfair to\ncompare this number with divorce statistics, for many of these\nseparated women are in</p>",
  "page-248": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">reality widowed, were the truth known, and in\nother cases the separation is not permanent.  Nevertheless, here lies\nthe seat of greatest moral danger.  There is little or no prostitution\namong these Negroes, and over three-fourths of the families, as found\nby house-to-house investigation, deserve to be classed as decent people\nwith considerable regard for female chastity.  To be sure, the ideas of\nthe mass would not suit New England, and there are many loose habits\nand notions.  Yet the rate of illegitimacy is undoubtedly lower than in\nAustria or Italy, and the women as a class are modest.  The plague-spot\nin sexual relations is easy marriage and easy separation.  This is no\nsudden development, nor the fruit of Emancipation.  It is the plain\nheritage from slavery.  In those days Sam, with his master's consent,\n\"took up\" with Mary.  No ceremony was necessary, and in the busy life\nof the great plantations of the Black Belt it was usually dispensed\nwith.  If now the master needed</p>",
  "page-249": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">Sam's work in another plantation or in\nanother part of the same plantation, or if he took a notion to sell the\nslave, Sam's married life with Mary was usually unceremoniously broken,\nand then it was clearly to the master's interest to have both of them\ntake new mates.  This widespread custom of two centuries has not been\neradicated in thirty years.  To-day Sam's grandson \"takes up\" with a\nwoman without license or ceremony; they live together decently and\nhonestly, and are, to all intents and purposes, man and wife.\nSometimes these unions are never broken until death; but in too many\ncases family quarrels, a roving spirit, a rival suitor, or perhaps more\nfrequently the hopeless battle to support a family, lead to separation,\nand a broken household is the result.  The Negro church has done much\nto stop this practice, and now most marriage ceremonies are performed\nby the pastors.

As soon as the green cotton-leaves appear above the\nground, another mortgage is given on the \"crop.\"  Every Saturday, or at\nlonger intervals, Sam calls upon the merchant for his \"rations\"; a\nfamily of five usually gets about thirty pounds of fat side-pork and a\ncouple of bushels of cornmeal a month.  Besides this, clothing and\nshoes must be furnished; if Sam or his family is sick, there are orders\non the druggist and doctor; if the mule wants shoeing, an order on the\nblacksmith, etc.  If Sam is a hard worker and crops promise well, he is\noften</p>",

And, indeed, the merchants tell\nmany a true tale of shiftlessness and cheating; of cotton picked at\nnight, mules disappearing, and tenants absconding.  But on the whole\nthe merchant of the Black Belt is the most prosperous man in the\nsection.  So skilfully and so closely has he drawn the bonds of the law\nabout the tenant, that the black man has often simply to choose between\npauperism and crime; he \"waives\" all homestead exemptions in his\ncontract; he cannot touch his own mortgaged crop, which the laws put\nalmost in the full control of the land-owner and of the merchant. </p>",
  "page-259": "<p class=\"no-indent\">When\nthe crop is growing the merchant watches it like a hawk; as soon as it\nis ready for market he takes possession of it, sells it, pays the\nlandowner his rent, subtracts his bill for supplies, and if, as\nsometimes happens, there is anything left, he hands it over to the\nblack serf for his Christmas celebration.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The direct result of this system is an all-cotton scheme of agriculture\nand the continued bankruptcy of the tenant.

The landlord therefore demands his rent\nin cotton, and the merchant will accept mortgages on no other crop.\nThere is no use asking the black tenant, then, to diversify his\ncrops,--he cannot under this system.

  "page-264": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">States,\nand especially in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, the Negroes on\nthe plantations in the back-country districts are still held at forced\nlabor practically without wages.  Especially is this true in districts\nwhere the farmers are composed of the more ignorant class of poor\nwhites, and the Negroes are beyond the reach of schools and intercourse\nwith their advancing fellows.  If such a peon should run away, the\nsheriff, elected by white suffrage, can usually be depended on to catch\nthe fugitive, return him, and ask no questions.  If he escape to\nanother county, a charge of petty thieving, easily true, can be\ndepended upon to secure his return.  Even if some unduly officious\nperson insist upon a trial, neighborly comity will probably make his\nconviction sure, and then the labor due the county can easily be bought\nby the master.  Such a system is impossible in the more civilized parts\nof the South, or near the large towns and cities; but in those vast\nstretches of land</p>",

This\nis really a revival of the old Roman idea of the patron under whose\nprotection the new-made freedman was put.  In many instances this\nsystem has been of great good to the Negro, and very often under the\nprotection and guidance of the former master's family, or other white\nfriends, the freedman progressed in wealth and morality.  But the same\nsystem has in other cases resulted in the refusal of whole communities\nto recognize the right of a Negro to change his habitation and to be\nmaster of his own fortunes.

Besides this, the\nchance for lawless oppression and illegal exactions is vastly greater\nin the country than in the city, and nearly all the more serious race\ndisturbances of the last decade have arisen from disputes in the count\nbetween master and man,--as, for instance, the Sam Hose affair.  As a\nresult of such a situation, there arose, first, the Black Belt; and,\nsecond, the Migration to Town.  The Black Belt was not, as many\nassumed, a movement toward fields of labor under more genial climatic\nconditions; it was primarily a huddling for self-protection,--a massing\nof the black</p>",
  "page-268": "<p class=\"no-indent\">population for mutual defence in order to secure the peace\nand tranquillity necessary to economic advance.  This movement took\nplace between Emancipation and 1880, and only partially accomplished\nthe desired results.

Only ten per cent of the adult\npopulation was born in the county, and yet the blacks outnumber the\nwhites four or five to one.  There is undoubtedly a security to the\nblacks in their very numbers,--a personal freedom from arbitrary\ntreatment, which makes hundreds of laborers cling to Dougherty in spite\nof low wages and economic distress.

To-day the\nfollowing economic classes are plainly differentiated among these\nNegroes.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">A \"submerged tenth\" of croppers, with a few paupers; forty per cent who\nare metayers and</p>",
  "page-273": "<p class=\"no-indent\">thirty-nine per cent of semi-metayers and\nwage-laborers.  There are left five per cent of money-renters and six\nper cent of freeholders,--the \"Upper Ten\" of the land.  The croppers\nare entirely without capital, even in the limited sense of food or\nmoney to keep them from seed-time to harvest.  All they furnish is\ntheir labor; the land-owner furnishes land, stock, tools, seed, and\nhouse; and at the end of the year the laborer gets from a third to a\nhalf of the crop.  Out of his share, however, comes pay and interest\nfor food and clothing advanced him during the year.  Thus we have a\nlaborer without capital and without wages, and an employer whose\ncapital is largely his employees' wages.  It is an unsatisfactory\narrangement, both for hirer and hired, and is usually in vogue on poor\nland with hard-pressed owners.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Above the croppers come the great mass of the black population who work\nthe land on their own responsibility, paying rent in cotton and\nsupported by</p>",
  "page-274": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">the crop-mortgage system.  After the war this system was\nattractive to the freedmen on account of its larger freedom and its\npossibility for making a surplus.  But with the carrying out of the\ncrop-lien system, the deterioration of the land, and the slavery of\ndebt, the position of the metayers has sunk to a dead level of\npractically unrewarded toil.  Formerly all tenants had some capital,\nand often considerable; but absentee landlordism, rising rack-rent, and\nfailing cotton have stripped them well-nigh of all, and probably not\nover half of them to-day own their mules.  The change from cropper to\ntenant was accomplished by fixing the rent.  If, now, the rent fixed\nwas reasonable, this was an incentive to the tenant to strive.  On the\nother hand, if the rent was too high, or if the land deteriorated, the\nresult was to discourage and check the efforts of the black peasantry.\nThere is no doubt that the latter case is true; that in Dougherty\nCounty every economic</p>",
  "page-275": "<p class=\"no-indent\">advantage of the price of cotton in market and of\nthe strivings of the tenant has been taken advantage of by the\nlandlords and merchants, and swallowed up in rent and interest.  If\ncotton rose in price, the rent rose even higher; if cotton fell, the\nrent remained or followed reluctantly.  If the tenant worked hard and\nraised a large crop, his rent was raised the next year; if that year\nthe crop failed, his corn was confiscated and his mule sold for debt.\nThere were, of course, exceptions to this,--cases of personal kindness\nand forbearance; but in the vast majority of cases the rule was to\nextract the uttermost farthing from the mass of the black farm laborers.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The average metayer pays from twenty to thirty per cent of his crop in\nrent.  The result of such rack-rent can only be evil,--abuse and\nneglect of the soil, deterioration in the character of the laborers,\nand a widespread sense of injustice.  \"Wherever the country is poor,\"\ncried</p>",
  "page-276": "<p class=\"no-indent\">Arthur Young, \"it is in the hands of metayers,\" and \"their\ncondition is more wretched than that of day-laborers.\"  He was talking\nof Italy a century ago; but he might have been talking of Dougherty\nCounty to-day.

Some receive a house with perhaps a garden-spot;\nthen supplies of food and clothing are advanced, and certain fixed\nwages are given at the end of the year, varying from thirty to sixty\ndollars, out of which the supplies must be paid for, with</p>",
  "page-277": "<p class=\"no-indent\">interest.\nAbout eighteen per cent of the population belong to this class of\nsemi-metayers, while twenty-two per cent are laborers paid by the month\nor year, and are either \"furnished\" by their own savings or perhaps\nmore usually by some merchant who takes his chances of payment.  Such\nlaborers receive from thirty-five to fifty cents a day during the\nworking season.  They are usually young unmarried persons, some being\nwomen; and when they marry they sink to the class of metayers, or, more\nseldom, become renters.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The renters for fixed money rentals are the first of the emerging\nclasses, and form five per cent of the families.  The sole advantage of\nthis small class is their freedom to choose their crops, and the\nincreased responsibility which comes through having money transactions.\nWhile some of the renters differ little in condition from the metayers,\nyet on the whole they are more intelligent and responsible persons, and\nare the</p>",
  "page-278": "<p class=\"no-indent\">ones who eventually become land-owners.  Their better character\nand greater shrewdness enable them to gain, perhaps to demand, better\nterms in rents; rented farms, varying from forty to a hundred acres,\nbear an average rental of about fifty-four dollars a year.  The men who\nconduct such farms do not long remain renters; either they sink to\nmetayers, or with a successful series of harvests rise to be\nland-owners.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">In 1870 the tax-books of Dougherty report no Negroes as landholders.\nIf there were any such at that time,--and there may have been a\nfew,--their land was probably held in the name of some white patron,--a\nmethod not uncommon during slavery.  In 1875 ownership of land had\nbegun with seven hundred and fifty acres; ten years later this had\nincreased to over sixty-five hundred acres, to nine thousand acres in\n1890 and ten thousand in 1900.  The total assessed property has in this\nsame period risen from eighty thousand</p>",
  "page-279": "<p class=\"no-indent\">dollars in 1875 to two hundred\nand forty thousand dollars in 1900.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Two circumstances complicate this development and make it in some\nrespects difficult to be sure of the real tendencies; they are the\npanic of 1893, and the low price of cotton in 1898.  Besides this, the\nsystem of assessing property in the country districts of Georgia is\nsomewhat antiquated and of uncertain statistical value; there are no\nassessors, and each man makes a sworn return to a tax-receiver.  Thus\npublic opinion plays a large part, and the returns vary strangely from\nyear to year.  Certainly these figures show the small amount of\naccumulated capital among the Negroes, and the consequent large\ndependence of their property on temporary prosperity.  They have little\nto tide over a few years of economic depression, and are at the mercy\nof the cotton-market far more than the whites.  And thus the\nland-owners, despite their marvellous efforts, are</p>",
  "page-280": "<p class=\"no-indent\">really a transient\nclass, continually being depleted by those who fall back into the class\nof renters or metayers, and augmented by newcomers from the masses.  Of\none hundred land-owners in 1898, half had bought their land since 1893,\na fourth between 1890 and 1893, a fifth between 1884 and 1890, and the\nrest between 1870 and 1884.

If they\nhad been given an economic start at Emancipation, if they had been in\nan enlightened and rich community which really desired their best good,\nthen we might perhaps call such a result small or even</p>",
  "page-281": "<p class=\"no-indent\">insignificant.\nBut for a few thousand poor ignorant field-hands, in the face of\npoverty, a falling market, and social stress, to save and capitalize\ntwo hundred thousand dollars in a generation has meant a tremendous\neffort.

Fully\nninety-four per cent have struggled for land and failed, and half of\nthem sit in hopeless serfdom.  For these there is one other avenue of\nescape toward which they have turned in increasing numbers, namely,\nmigration to town.  A glance at the distribution of land</p>",
  "page-282": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">among the\nblack owners curiously reveals this fact.  In 1898 the holdings were as\nfollows: Under forty acres, forty-nine families; forty to two hundred\nand fifty acres, seventeen families; two hundred and fifty to one\nthousand acres, thirteen families; one thousand or more acres, two\nfamilies.  Now in 1890 there were forty-four holdings, but only nine of\nthese were under forty acres.  The great increase of holdings, then,\nhas come in the buying of small homesteads near town, where their\nowners really share in the town life; this is a part of the rush to\ntown.  And for every land-owner who has thus hurried away from the\nnarrow and hard conditions of country life, how many field-hands, how\nmany tenants, how many ruined renters, have joined that long\nprocession?

  "page-288": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">their relations\nto each other fall in a few main lines of action and communication:\nthere is, first, the physical proximity of home and dwelling-places,\nthe way in which neighborhoods group themselves, and the contiguity of\nneighborhoods.

Closely allied with this come the various forms of\nsocial</p>",
  "page-289": "<p class=\"no-indent\">contact in everyday life, in travel, in theatres, in house\ngatherings, in marrying and giving in marriage.  Finally, there are the\nvarying forms of religious enterprise, of moral teaching and benevolent\nendeavor.  These are the principal ways in which men living in the same\ncommunities are brought into contact with each other.

It is usually possible to draw in\nnearly every Southern community a physical color-line on the map, on\nthe one side of which whites dwell and on the other Negroes.  The\nwinding and intricacy of the geographical color-line varies, of course,\nin different communities.  I know some towns where a straight line\ndrawn through the middle of the main street separates nine-tenths of\nthe whites from nine-tenths of the blacks.  In other towns the older\nsettlement</p>",
  "page-290": "<p class=\"no-indent\">of whites has been encircled by a broad band of blacks; in\nstill other cases little settlements or nuclei of blacks have sprung up\namid surrounding whites.

Even in the country something of this segregation is\nmanifest in the smaller areas, and of course in the larger phenomena of\nthe Black Belt.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">All this segregation by color is largely independent of that natural\nclustering by social grades common to all communities.  A Negro slum\nmay be in dangerous proximity to a white residence quarter, while it is\nquite common to find a white slum planted in the heart of a respectable\nNegro district.  One thing, however, seldom occurs: the best of the\nwhites and the best of the Negroes almost never live in anything like\nclose proximity.  It thus happens that in nearly every Southern town\nand city, both whites and blacks see commonly</p>",
  "page-291": "<p class=\"no-indent\">the worst of each other.\nThis is a vast change from the situation in the past, when, through the\nclose contact of master and house-servant in the patriarchal big house,\none found the best of both races in close contact and sympathy, while\nat the same time the squalor and dull round of toil among the\nfield-hands was removed from the sight and hearing of the family.  One\ncan easily see how a person who saw slavery thus from his father's\nparlors, and sees freedom on the streets of a great city, fails to\ngrasp or comprehend the whole of the new picture.  On the other hand,\nthe settled belief of the mass of the Negroes that the Southern white\npeople do not have the black man's best interests at heart has been\nintensified in later years by this continual daily contact of the\nbetter class of blacks with the worst representatives of the white race.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Coming now to the economic relations of the races, we are on ground\nmade familiar by study, much</p>",
  "page-292": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">discussion, and no little philanthropic\neffort.  And yet with all this there are many essential elements in the\ncooperation of Negroes and whites for work and wealth that are too\nreadily overlooked or not thoroughly understood.  The average American\ncan easily conceive of a rich land awaiting development and filled with\nblack laborers.  To him the Southern problem is simply that of making\nefficient workingmen out of this material, by giving them the requisite\ntechnical skill and the help of invested capital.  The problem,\nhowever, is by no means as simple as this, from the obvious fact that\nthese workingmen have been trained for centuries as slaves.  They\nexhibit, therefore, all the advantages and defects of such training;\nthey are willing and good-natured, but not self-reliant, provident, or\ncareful.  If now the economic development of the South is to be pushed\nto the verge of exploitation, as seems probable, then we have a mass of\nworkingmen thrown into</p>",
  "page-293": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">relentless competition with the workingmen of\nthe world, but handicapped by a training the very opposite to that of\nthe modern self-reliant democratic laborer.  What the black laborer\nneeds is careful personal guidance, group leadership of men with hearts\nin their bosoms, to train them to foresight, carefulness, and honesty.\nNor does it require any fine-spun theories of racial differences to\nprove the necessity of such group training after the brains of the race\nhave been knocked out by two hundred and fifty years of assiduous\neducation in submission, carelessness, and stealing.  After\nEmancipation, it was the plain duty of some one to assume this group\nleadership and training of the Negro laborer.

  "page-294": "<p class=\"no-indent\">bondmen; I will not stop to ask whose duty it was, but\nI insist it was the duty of some one to see that these workingmen were\nnot left alone and unguided, without capital, without land, without\nskill, without economic organization, without even the bald protection\nof law, order, and decency,--left in a great land, not to settle down\nto slow and careful internal development, but destined to be thrown\nalmost immediately into relentless and sharp competition with the best\nof modern workingmen under an economic system where every participant\nis fighting for himself, and too often utterly regardless of the rights\nor welfare of his neighbor.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">For we must never forget that the economic system of the South to-day\nwhich has succeeded the old regime is not the same system as that of\nthe old industrial North, of England, or of France, with their\ntrade-unions, their restrictive laws, their written and</p>",
  "page-295": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">unwritten\ncommercial customs, and their long experience.  It is, rather, a copy\nof that England of the early nineteenth century, before the factory\nacts,--the England that wrung pity from thinkers and fired the wrath of\nCarlyle.

Rather it has passed to those men who have\ncome to take charge of the industrial exploitation of the New\nSouth,--the sons of poor whites fired with a new thirst for wealth and\npower, thrifty and avaricious Yankees, and unscrupulous immigrants.\nInto the hands of these men the Southern laborers, white and black,\nhave fallen; and this to their sorrow.  For the laborers as such, there\nis in these new captains of industry neither love nor hate, neither\nsympathy nor romance; it is a cold question of dollars and dividends.\nUnder such a system all labor is bound to suffer.  Even the white\nlaborers are</p>",

  "page-309": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">South is closely\nconnected with the question of Negro crime.  There can be no doubt that\ncrime among Negroes has sensibly increased in the last thirty years,\nand that there has appeared in the slums of great cities a distinct\ncriminal class among the blacks.  In explaining this unfortunate\ndevelopment, we must note two things: (1) that the inevitable result of\nEmancipation was to increase crime and criminals, and (2) that the\npolice system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves.\nAs to the first point, we must not forget that under a strict slave\nsystem there can scarcely be such a thing as crime.  But when these\nvariously constituted human particles are suddenly thrown broadcast on\nthe sea of life, some swim, some sink, and some hang suspended, to be\nforced up or down by the chance currents of a busy hurrying world.  So\ngreat an economic and social revolution as swept the South in '63 meant\na weeding out among the Negroes of the</p>",

Now a rising group of\npeople are not lifted bodily from the ground like an inert solid mass,\nbut rather stretch upward like a living plant with its roots still\nclinging in the mould.  The appearance, therefore, of the Negro\ncriminal was a phenomenon to be awaited; and while it causes anxiety,\nit should not occasion surprise.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Here again the hope for the future depended peculiarly on careful and\ndelicate dealing with these criminals.  Their offences at first were\nthose of laziness, carelessness, and impulse, rather than of malignity\nor ungoverned viciousness.  Such misdemeanors needed discriminating\ntreatment, firm but reformatory, with no hint of injustice, and full\nproof of guilt.  For such dealing with criminals, white or black, the\nSouth had no machinery, no adequate jails or reformatories; its police\nsystem was arranged to deal with blacks alone, and</p>",
  "page-311": "<p class=\"no-indent\">tacitly assumed that\nevery white man was ipso facto a member of that police.  Thus grew up a\ndouble system of justice, which erred on the white side by undue\nleniency and the practical immunity of red-handed criminals, and erred\non the black side by undue severity, injustice, and lack of\ndiscrimination.  For, as I have said, the police system of the South\nwas originally designed to keep track of all Negroes, not simply of\ncriminals; and when the Negroes were freed and the whole South was\nconvinced of the impossibility of free Negro labor, the first and\nalmost universal device was to use the courts as a means of reenslaving\nthe blacks.  It was not then a question of crime, but rather one of\ncolor, that settled a man's conviction on almost any charge.  Thus\nNegroes came to look upon courts as instruments of injustice and\noppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">When, now, the real Negro criminal appeared, and</p>",
  "page-312": "<p class=\"no-indent\">instead of petty\nstealing and vagrancy we began to have highway robbery, burglary,\nmurder, and rape, there was a curious effect on both sides the\ncolor-line: the Negroes refused to believe the evidence of white\nwitnesses or the fairness of white juries, so that the greatest\ndeterrent to crime, the public opinion of one's own social caste, was\nlost, and the criminal was looked upon as crucified rather than hanged.\nOn the other hand, the whites, used to being careless as to the guilt\nor innocence of accused Negroes, were swept in moments of passion\nbeyond law, reason, and decency.  Such a situation is bound to increase\ncrime, and has increased it.  To natural viciousness and vagrancy are\nbeing daily added motives of revolt and revenge which stir up all the\nlatent savagery of both races and make peaceful attention to economic\ndevelopment often impossible.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">But the chief problem in any community cursed with crime is not the\npunishment of the criminals, but</p>",
  "page-313": "<p class=\"no-indent\">the preventing of the young from being\ntrained to crime.  And here again the peculiar conditions of the South\nhave prevented proper precautions.  I have seen twelve-year-old boys\nworking in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front\nof the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this\nindiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the\nchain-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauchery.

Of every five\ndollars spent for public education in the State of Georgia, the white\nschools get four dollars and the Negro one dollar; and even then the\nwhite public-school system, save in the cities, is bad and cries for\nreform.  If this is true of the whites, what of the blacks?  I am\nbecoming more and more convinced, as I look upon the system of\ncommon-school training in the South, that the national government must\nsoon step in and aid popular education in some way.  To-day it has been\nonly by the most strenuous efforts on the part of the thinking men of\nthe South that the Negro's share of the school fund has not been cut\ndown to a pittance in some half-dozen States; and that movement not\nonly is not dead, but in many communities is gaining strength.

The people moaned and fluttered, and then the\ngaunt-cheeked brown woman beside me suddenly leaped straight into the\nair and shrieked like a lost soul, while round about came wail and\ngroan and outcry, and a scene of human passion such as I had never\nconceived before.</p>",
  "page-331": "<p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Those who have not thus witnessed the frenzy of a Negro revival in the\nuntouched backwoods of the South can but dimly realize the religious\nfeeling of the slave; as described, such scenes appear grotesque and\nfunny, but as seen they are awful.  Three things characterized this\nreligion of the slave,--the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy.  The\nPreacher is the most unique personality developed by the Negro on\nAmerican soil.  A leader, a politician, an orator, a \"boss,\" an\nintriguer, an idealist,--all these he is, and ever, too, the centre of\na group of men, now twenty, now a thousand in number.  The combination\nof a certain adroitness with deep-seated earnestness, of tact with\nconsummate ability, gave him his preeminence, and helps him maintain\nit.  The type, of course, varies according to time and place, from the\nWest Indies in the sixteenth century to New England in the nineteenth,\nand from the Mississippi bottoms to cities like New</p>",
  "page-332": "<p class=\"no-indent\">Orleans or New York.</p><p>The Music of Negro religion is that plaintive rhythmic melody, with its\ntouching minor cadences, which, despite caricature and defilement,\nstill remains the most original and beautiful expression of human life\nand longing yet born on American soil.  Sprung from the African\nforests, where its counterpart can still be heard, it was adapted,\nchanged, and intensified by the tragic soul-life of the slave, until,\nunder the stress of law and whip, it became the one true expression of\na people's sorrow, despair, and hope.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Finally the Frenzy of \"Shouting,\" when the Spirit of the Lord passed\nby, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy, was\nthe last essential of Negro religion and the one more devoutly believed\nin than all the rest.  It varied in expression from the silent rapt\ncountenance or the low murmur and moan to the mad abandon of physical\nfervor,--the stamping,</p>",
  "page-333": "<p class=\"no-indent\">shrieking, and shouting, the rushing to and fro\nand wild waving of arms, the weeping and laughing, the vision and the\ntrance.  All this is nothing new in the world, but old as religion, as\nDelphi and Endor.  And so firm a hold did it have on the Negro, that\nmany generations firmly believed that without this visible\nmanifestation of the God there could be no true communion with the\nInvisible.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">These were the characteristics of Negro religious life as developed up\nto the time of Emancipation.  Since under the peculiar circumstances of\nthe black man's environment they were the one expression of his higher\nlife, they are of deep interest to the student of his development, both\nsocially and psychologically.  Numerous are the attractive lines of\ninquiry that here group themselves.  What did slavery mean to the\nAfrican savage?  What was his attitude toward the World and Life?  What\nseemed to him good and evil,--God and</p>",
  "page-334": "<p class=\"no-indent\">Devil?  Whither went his longings\nand strivings, and wherefore were his heart-burnings and\ndisappointments?

The mass of \"gospel\" hymns which has swept\nthrough American churches and</p>",
  "page-335": "<p class=\"no-indent\">well-nigh ruined our sense of song\nconsists largely of debased imitations of Negro melodies made by ears\nthat caught the jingle but not the music, the body but not the soul, of\nthe Jubilee songs.  It is thus clear that the study of Negro religion\nis not only a vital part of the history of the Negro in America, but no\nuninteresting part of American history.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The Negro church of to-day is the social centre of Negro life in the\nUnited States, and the most characteristic expression of African\ncharacter.  Take a typical church in a small Virginia town: it is the\n\"First Baptist\"--a roomy brick edifice seating five hundred or more\npersons, tastefully finished in Georgia pine, with a carpet, a small\norgan, and stained-glass windows.  Underneath is a large assembly room\nwith benches.  This building is the central club-house of a community\nof a thousand or more Negroes.  Various organizations meet here,--the\nchurch proper, the Sunday-school, two</p>",
  "page-336": "<p class=\"no-indent\">or three insurance societies,\nwomen's societies, secret societies, and mass meetings of various\nkinds.  Entertainments, suppers, and lectures are held beside the five\nor six regular weekly religious services.  Considerable sums of money\nare collected and expended here, employment is found for the idle,\nstrangers are introduced, news is disseminated and charity distributed.\nAt the same time this social, intellectual, and economic centre is a\nreligious centre of great power.  Depravity, Sin, Redemption, Heaven,\nHell, and Damnation are preached twice a Sunday after the crops are\nlaid by; and few indeed of the community have the hardihood to\nwithstand conversion.  Back of this more formal religion, the Church\noften stands as a real conserver of morals, a strengthener of family\nlife, and the final authority on what is Good and Right.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Thus one can see in the Negro church to-day, reproduced in microcosm,\nall the great world from</p>",
  "page-337": "<p class=\"no-indent\">which the Negro is cut off by color-prejudice\nand social condition.  In the great city churches the same tendency is\nnoticeable and in many respects emphasized.  A great church like the\nBethel of Philadelphia has over eleven hundred members, an edifice\nseating fifteen hundred persons and valued at one hundred thousand\ndollars, an annual budget of five thousand dollars, and a government\nconsisting of a pastor with several assisting local preachers, an\nexecutive and legislative board, financial boards and tax collectors;\ngeneral church meetings for making laws; sub-divided groups led by\nclass leaders, a company of militia, and twenty-four auxiliary\nsocieties.  The activity of a church like this is immense and\nfar-reaching, and the bishops who preside over these organizations\nthroughout the land are among the most powerful Negro rulers in the\nworld.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Such churches are really governments of men, and consequently a little\ninvestigation reveals the curious</p>",
  "page-338": "<p class=\"no-indent\">fact that, in the South, at least,\npractically every American Negro is a church member.  Some, to be sure,\nare not regularly enrolled, and a few do not habitually attend\nservices; but, practically, a proscribed people must have a social\ncentre, and that centre for this people is the Negro church.  The\ncensus of 1890 showed nearly twenty-four thousand Negro churches in the\ncountry, with a total enrolled membership of over two and a half\nmillions, or ten actual church members to every twenty-eight persons,\nand in some Southern States one in every two persons.  Besides these\nthere is the large number who, while not enrolled as members, attend\nand take part in many of the activities of the church.  There is an\norganized Negro church for every sixty black families in the nation,\nand in some States for every forty families, owning, on an average, a\nthousand dollars' worth of property each, or nearly twenty-six million\ndollars in all.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Such, then, is the large development of the Negro</p>",
  "page-339": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">church since\nEmancipation.  The question now is, What have been the successive steps\nof this social history and what are the present tendencies?  First, we\nmust realize that no such institution as the Negro church could rear\nitself without definite historical foundations.  These foundations we\ncan find if we remember that the social history of the Negro did not\nstart in America.  He was brought from a definite social\nenvironment,--the polygamous clan life under the headship of the chief\nand the potent influence of the priest.  His religion was\nnature-worship, with profound belief in invisible surrounding\ninfluences, good and bad, and his worship was through incantation and\nsacrifice.  The first rude change in this life was the slave ship and\nthe West Indian sugar-fields.  The plantation organization replaced the\nclan and tribe, and the white master replaced the chief with far\ngreater and more despotic powers.  Forced and long-continued toil\nbecame the rule of life, the old ties</p>",
  "page-340": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">of blood relationship and kinship\ndisappeared, and instead of the family appeared a new polygamy and\npolyandry, which, in some cases, almost reached promiscuity.  It was a\nterrific social revolution, and yet some traces were retained of the\nformer group life, and the chief remaining institution was the Priest\nor Medicine-man.  He early appeared on the plantation and found his\nfunction as the healer of the sick, the interpreter of the Unknown, the\ncomforter of the sorrowing, the supernatural avenger of wrong, and the\none who rudely but picturesquely expressed the longing, disappointment,\nand resentment of a stolen and oppressed people.  Thus, as bard,\nphysician, judge, and priest, within the narrow limits allowed by the\nslave system, rose the Negro preacher, and under him the first church\nwas not at first by any means Christian nor definitely organized;\nrather it was an adaptation and mingling of heathen rites among the\nmembers of each</p>",
  "page-341": "<p class=\"no-indent\">plantation, and roughly designated as Voodooism.\nAssociation with the masters, missionary effort and motives of\nexpediency gave these rites an early veneer of Christianity, and after\nthe lapse of many generations the Negro church became Christian.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Two characteristic things must be noticed in regard to the church.\nFirst, it became almost entirely Baptist and Methodist in faith;\nsecondly, as a social institution it antedated by many decades the\nmonogamic Negro home.  From the very circumstances of its beginning,\nthe church was confined to the plantation, and consisted primarily of a\nseries of disconnected units; although, later on, some freedom of\nmovement was allowed, still this geographical limitation was always\nimportant and was one cause of the spread of the decentralized and\ndemocratic Baptist faith among the slaves.  At the same time, the\nvisible rite of baptism appealed strongly to their mystic temperament.\nTo-day</p>",
  "page-342": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">the Baptist Church is still largest in membership among Negroes,\nand has a million and a half communicants.  Next in popularity came the\nchurches organized in connection with the white neighboring churches,\nchiefly Baptist and Methodist, with a few Episcopalian and others.  The\nMethodists still form the second greatest denomination, with nearly a\nmillion members.  The faith of these two leading denominations was more\nsuited to the slave church from the prominence they gave to religious\nfeeling and fervor.  The Negro membership in other denominations has\nalways been small and relatively unimportant, although the\nEpiscopalians and Presbyterians are gaining among the more intelligent\nclasses to-day, and the Catholic Church is making headway in certain\nsections.  After Emancipation, and still earlier in the North, the\nNegro churches largely severed such affiliations as they had had with\nthe white churches, either by choice or by</p>",
  "page-343": "<p class=\"no-indent\">compulsion.  The Baptist\nchurches became independent, but the Methodists were compelled early to\nunite for purposes of episcopal government.  This gave rise to the\ngreat African Methodist Church, the greatest Negro organization in the\nworld, to the Zion Church and the Colored Methodist, and to the black\nconferences and churches in this and other denominations.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The second fact noted, namely, that the Negro church antedates the\nNegro home, leads to an explanation of much that is paradoxical in this\ncommunistic institution and in the morals of its members.  But\nespecially it leads us to regard this institution as peculiarly the\nexpression of the inner ethical life of a people in a sense seldom true\nelsewhere.  Let us turn, then, from the outer physical development of\nthe church to the more important inner ethical life of the people who\ncompose it.  The Negro has already been</p>",
  "page-344": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">pointed out many times as a\nreligious animal,--a being of that deep emotional nature which turns\ninstinctively toward the supernatural.  Endowed with a rich tropical\nimagination and a keen, delicate appreciation of Nature, the\ntransplanted African lived in a world animate with gods and devils,\nelves and witches; full of strange influences,--of Good to be implored,\nof Evil to be propitiated.  Slavery, then, was to him the dark triumph\nof Evil over him.  All the hateful powers of the Under-world were\nstriving against him, and a spirit of revolt and revenge filled his\nheart.  He called up all the resources of heathenism to aid,--exorcism\nand witch-craft, the mysterious Obi worship with its barbarious rites,\nspells, and blood-sacrifice even, now and then, of human victims.\nWeird midnight orgies and mystic conjurations were invoked, the\nwitch-woman and the voodoo-priest became the centre of Negro group\nlife, and that vein of vague superstition which characterizes</p>",
  "page-345": "<p class=\"no-indent\">the\nunlettered Negro even to-day was deepened and strengthened.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">In spite, however, of such success as that of the fierce Maroons, the\nDanish blacks, and others, the spirit of revolt gradually died away\nunder the untiring energy and superior strength of the slave masters.\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century the black slave had sunk, with\nhushed murmurs, to his place at the bottom of a new economic system,\nand was unconsciously ripe for a new philosophy of life.  Nothing\nsuited his condition then better than the doctrines of passive\nsubmission embodied in the newly learned Christianity.  Slave masters\nearly realized this, and cheerfully aided religious propaganda within\ncertain bounds.  The long system of repression and degradation of the\nNegro tended to emphasize the elements of his character which made him\na valuable chattel: courtesy became humility, moral strength\ndegenerated into submission,</p>",
  "page-346": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and the exquisite native appreciation of\nthe beautiful became an infinite capacity for dumb suffering.  The\nNegro, losing the joy of this world, eagerly seized upon the offered\nconceptions of the next; the avenging Spirit of the Lord enjoining\npatience in this world, under sorrow and tribulation until the Great\nDay when He should lead His dark children home,--this became his\ncomforting dream.  His preacher repeated the prophecy, and his bards\nsang,--</p><p>  \"Children, we all shall be free\n  When the Lord shall appear!\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">This deep religious fatalism, painted so beautifully in \"Uncle Tom,\"\ncame soon to breed, as all fatalistic faiths will, the sensualist side\nby side with the martyr.

  "page-347": "<p class=\"no-indent\">philosophy of indulgence and crime.  Many of\nthe worst characteristics of the Negro masses of to-day had their seed\nin this period of the slave's ethical growth.

We often neglect the influence\nof the freedman before the war, because of the paucity of his numbers\nand the small weight he had in the history of the nation.  But we must\nnot forget that his chief influence was internal,--was exerted on the\nblack world; and that there he was the ethical and social leader.\nHuddled as he was in a few centres like Philadelphia, New York, and New\nOrleans, the masses of the freedmen sank into poverty and listlessness;\nbut not all of them.  The free Negro</p>",
  "page-348": "<p class=\"no-indent\">leader early arose and his chief\ncharacteristic was intense earnestness and deep feeling on the slavery\nquestion.  Freedom became to him a real thing and not a dream.  His\nreligion became darker and more intense, and into his ethics crept a\nnote of revenge, into his songs a day of reckoning close at hand.  The\n\"Coming of the Lord\" swept this side of Death, and came to be a thing\nto be hoped for in this day.  Through fugitive slaves and irrepressible\ndiscussion this desire for freedom seized the black millions still in\nbondage, and became their one ideal of life.  The black bards caught\nnew notes, and sometimes even dared to sing,--</p><p>  \"O Freedom, O Freedom, O Freedom over me!\n  Before I'll be a slave\n  I'll be buried in my grave,\n  And go home to my Lord\n  And be free.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">For fifty years Negro religion thus transformed itself and identified\nitself with the dream of Abolition, until that which was a radical fad\nin the white North and an</p>",
  "page-349": "<p class=\"no-indent\">anarchistic plot in the white South had\nbecome a religion to the black world.  Thus, when Emancipation finally\ncame, it seemed to the freedman a literal Coming of the Lord.  His\nfervid imagination was stirred as never before, by the tramp of armies,\nthe blood and dust of battle, and the wail and whirl of social\nupheaval.  He stood dumb and motionless before the whirlwind: what had\nhe to do with it?  Was it not the Lord's doing, and marvellous in his\neyes?  Joyed and bewildered with what came, he stood awaiting new\nwonders till the inevitable Age of Reaction swept over the nation and\nbrought the crisis of to-day.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It is difficult to explain clearly the present critical stage of Negro\nreligion.  First, we must remember that living as the blacks do in\nclose contact with a great modern nation, and sharing, although\nimperfectly, the soul-life of that nation, they must necessarily be\naffected more or less directly by all the religious and ethical</p>",
  "page-350": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">forces\nthat are to-day moving the United States.  These questions and\nmovements are, however, overshadowed and dwarfed by the (to them)\nall-important question of their civil, political, and economic status.\nThey must perpetually discuss the \"Negro Problem,\"--must live, move,\nand have their being in it, and interpret all else in its light or\ndarkness.  With this come, too, peculiar problems of their inner\nlife,--of the status of women, the maintenance of Home, the training of\nchildren, the accumulation of wealth, and the prevention of crime.  All\nthis must mean a time of intense ethical ferment, of religious\nheart-searching and intellectual unrest.  From the double life every\nAmerican Negro must live, as a Negro and as an American, as swept on by\nthe current of the nineteenth while yet struggling in the eddies of the\nfifteenth century,--from this must arise a painful self-consciousness,\nan almost morbid sense of personality and a moral hesitancy which is\nfatal to</p>",
  "page-351": "<p class=\"no-indent\">self-confidence.  The worlds within and without the Veil of\nColor are changing, and changing rapidly, but not at the same rate, not\nin the same way; and this must produce a peculiar wrenching of the\nsoul, a peculiar sense of doubt and bewilderment.  Such a double life,\nwith double thoughts, double duties, and double social classes, must\ngive rise to double words and double ideals, and tempt the mind to\npretence or revolt, to hypocrisy or radicalism.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">In some such doubtful words and phrases can one perhaps most clearly\npicture the peculiar ethical paradox that faces the Negro of to-day and\nis tingeing and changing his religious life.  Feeling that his rights\nand his dearest ideals are being trampled upon, that the public\nconscience is ever more deaf to his righteous appeal, and that all the\nreactionary forces of prejudice, greed, and revenge are daily gaining\nnew strength and fresh allies, the Negro faces no enviable</p>",
  "page-352": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">dilemma.\nConscious of his impotence, and pessimistic, he often becomes bitter\nand vindictive; and his religion, instead of a worship, is a complaint\nand a curse, a wail rather than a hope, a sneer rather than a faith.\nOn the other hand, another type of mind, shrewder and keener and more\ntortuous too, sees in the very strength of the anti-Negro movement its\npatent weaknesses, and with Jesuitic casuistry is deterred by no\nethical considerations in the endeavor to turn this weakness to the\nblack man's strength.  Thus we have two great and hardly reconcilable\nstreams of thought and ethical strivings; the danger of the one lies in\nanarchy, that of the other in hypocrisy.  The one type of Negro stands\nalmost ready to curse God and die, and the other is too often found a\ntraitor to right and a coward before force; the one is wedded to ideals\nremote, whimsical, perhaps impossible of realization; the other forgets\nthat life is more than meat and the body more than raiment.

And how natural this is!  The death of Denmark\nVesey and Nat Turner proved long since to the Negro the present\nhopelessness of physical defence.  Political defence is becoming less\nand less available, and economic defence is still only partially\neffective.  But there is a patent defence at hand,--the defence of\ndeception and flattery, of cajoling and lying.  It is the same defence\nwhich peasants of the Middle Age used and which left its stamp on their\ncharacter for centuries.  To-day the young Negro of the South who would\nsucceed cannot be frank and outspoken, honest and self-assertive, but\nrather he is daily tempted to be</p>",
  "page-355": "<p class=\"no-indent\">silent and wary, politic and sly; he\nmust flatter and be pleasant, endure petty insults with a smile, shut\nhis eyes to wrong; in too many cases he sees positive personal\nadvantage in deception and lying.

Patience, humility, and adroitness must, in these\ngrowing black youth, replace impulse, manliness, and courage.  With\nthis sacrifice there is an economic opening, and perhaps peace and some\nprosperity.  Without this there is riot, migration, or crime.

Through her I came to love the wee\nthing, as it grew strong; as its little soul unfolded itself in twitter\nand cry and half-formed word, and as its eyes caught the gleam and\nflash of life.

Why was his hair tinted with gold?  An evil omen\nwas golden hair in my life.  Why had not the brown of his eyes crushed\nout and killed the blue?--for brown were his father's eyes, and his\nfather's father's.

I spoke to him politely, then curiously, then eagerly, as I began\nto feel the fineness of his character,--his calm courtesy, the\nsweetness of his strength, and his fair blending of the hope and truth\nof life.  Instinctively I bowed before this man, as one bows before the\nprophets of the world.  Some seer he seemed, that came not from the\ncrimson Past or the gray To-come, but from the pulsing Now,--that\nmocking world which seemed to me at once so light and dark, so splendid\nand sordid.  Fourscore years had he wandered in this same world of\nmine, within the Veil.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">He was born with the Missouri Compromise and lay a-dying amid the\nechoes of Manila and El Caney: stirring times for living, times dark to\nlook back upon, darker to look forward to.

Thus the temptation\nof Hate grew and shadowed the growing child,--gliding stealthily into\nhis laughter, fading into his play, and seizing his dreams by day and\nnight with rough, rude turbulence.  So the black boy asked of sky and\nsun and</p>",
  "page-376": "<p class=\"no-indent\">flower the never-answered Why? and loved, as he grew, neither\nthe world nor the world's rough ways.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Strange temptation for a child, you may think; and yet in this wide\nland to-day a thousand thousand dark children brood before this same\ntemptation, and feel its cold and shuddering arms.  For them, perhaps,\nsome one will some day lift the Veil,--will come tenderly and cheerily\ninto those sad little lives and brush the brooding hate away, just as\nBeriah Green strode in upon the life of Alexander Crummell.  And before\nthe bluff, kind-hearted man the shadow seemed less dark.  Beriah Green\nhad a school in Oneida County, New York, with a score of mischievous\nboys.  \"I'm going to bring a black boy here to educate,\" said Beriah\nGreen, as only a crank and an abolitionist would have dared to say.\n\"Oho!\" laughed the boys.  \"Ye-es,\" said his wife; and Alexander came.\nOnce before, the black boy had sought a school, had travelled, cold and\nhungry, four hundred miles up</p>",
  "page-377": "<p class=\"no-indent\">into free New Hampshire, to Canaan.  But\nthe godly farmers hitched ninety yoke of oxen to the abolition\nschoolhouse and dragged it into the middle of the swamp.  The black boy\ntrudged away.</p><p>The nineteenth was the first century of human sympathy,--the age when\nhalf wonderingly we began to descry in others that transfigured spark\nof divinity which we call Myself; when clodhoppers and peasants, and\ntramps and thieves, and millionaires and--sometimes--Negroes, became\nthrobbing souls whose warm pulsing life touched us so nearly that we\nhalf gasped with surprise, crying, \"Thou too!

Hast Thou known Life?\"  And then\nall helplessly we peered into those Other-worlds, and wailed, \"O World\nof Worlds, how shall man make you one?\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">So in that little Oneida school there came to those schoolboys a\nrevelation of thought and longing beneath</p>",
  "page-378": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">one black skin, of which they\nhad not dreamed before.  And to the lonely boy came a new dawn of\nsympathy and inspiration.  The shadowy, formless thing--the temptation\nof Hate, that hovered between him and the world--grew fainter and less\nsinister.  It did not wholly fade away, but diffused itself and\nlingered thick at the edges.  Through it the child now first saw the\nblue and gold of life,--the sun-swept road that ran 'twixt heaven and\nearth until in one far-off wan wavering line they met and kissed.  A\nvision of life came to the growing boy,--mystic, wonderful.  He raised\nhis head, stretched himself, breathed deep of the fresh new air.\nYonder, behind the forests, he heard strange sounds; then glinting\nthrough the trees he saw, far, far away, the bronzed hosts of a nation\ncalling,--calling faintly, calling loudly.  He heard the hateful clank\nof their chains; he felt them cringe and grovel, and there rose within\nhim a protest and a prophecy.  And he girded himself to walk</p>",
  "page-379": "<p class=\"no-indent\">down the\nworld.</p><p>A voice and vision called him to be a priest,--a seer to lead the\nuncalled out of the house of bondage.  He saw the headless host turn\ntoward him like the whirling of mad waters,--he stretched forth his\nhands eagerly, and then, even as he stretched them, suddenly there\nswept across the vision the temptation of Despair.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">They were not wicked men,--the problem of life is not the problem of\nthe wicked,--they were calm, good men, Bishops of the Apostolic Church\nof God, and strove toward righteousness.  They said slowly, \"It is all\nvery natural--it is even commendable; but the General Theological\nSeminary of the Episcopal Church cannot admit a Negro.\"  And when that\nthin, half-grotesque figure still haunted their doors, they put their\nhands kindly, half sorrowfully, on his shoulders, and said, \"Now,--of\ncourse, we--we know how YOU feel about it; but you see it is\nimpossible,--that is--well--it is</p>",
  "page-380": "<p class=\"no-indent\">premature.  Sometime, we\ntrust--sincerely trust--all such distinctions will fade away; but now\nthe world is as it is.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">This was the temptation of Despair; and the young man fought it\ndoggedly.  Like some grave shadow he flitted by those halls, pleading,\narguing, half angrily demanding admittance, until there came the final\nNO: until men hustled the disturber away, marked him as foolish,\nunreasonable, and injudicious, a vain rebel against God's law.  And\nthen from that Vision Splendid all the glory faded slowly away, and\nleft an earth gray and stern rolling on beneath a dark despair.  Even\nthe kind hands that stretched themselves toward him from out the depths\nof that dull morning seemed but parts of the purple shadows.  He saw\nthem coldly, and asked, \"Why should I strive by special grace when the\nway of the world is closed to me?\"  All gently yet, the hands urged him\non,--the hands of young John Jay, that daring</p>",
  "page-381": "<p class=\"no-indent\">father's daring son; the\nhands of the good folk of Boston, that free city.  And yet, with a way\nto the priesthood of the Church open at last before him, the cloud\nlingered there; and even when in old St. Paul's the venerable Bishop\nraised his white arms above the Negro deacon--even then the burden had\nnot lifted from that heart, for there had passed a glory from the earth.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">And yet the fire through which Alexander Crummell went did not burn in\nvain.  Slowly and more soberly he took up again his plan of life.  More\ncritically he studied the situation.  Deep down below the slavery and\nservitude of the Negro people he saw their fatal weaknesses, which long\nyears of mistreatment had emphasized.  The dearth of strong moral\ncharacter, of unbending righteousness, he felt, was their great\nshortcoming, and here he would begin.  He would gather the best of his\npeople into some little Episcopal chapel and there lead, teach, and\ninspire them, till the</p>",
  "page-382": "<p class=\"no-indent\">leaven spread, till the children grew, till the\nworld hearkened, till--till--and then across his dream gleamed some\nfaint after-glow of that first fair vision of youth--only an\nafter-glow, for there had passed a glory from the earth.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">One day--it was in 1842, and the springtide was struggling merrily with\nthe May winds of New England--he stood at last in his own chapel in\nProvidence, a priest of the Church.

He\nworked and toiled, week by week, day by day, month by month.  And yet\nmonth by month the congregation dwindled, week by week the hollow walls\nechoed more sharply, day by day the calls came fewer and fewer, and day\nby day the third temptation sat clearer and still</p>",
  "page-383": "<p class=\"no-indent\">more clearly within\nthe Veil; a temptation, as it were, bland and smiling, with just a\nshade of mockery in its smooth tones.  First it came casually, in the\ncadence of a voice: \"Oh, colored folks?  Yes.\"  Or perhaps more</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">definitely: \"What do you EXPECT?\"  In voice and gesture lay the\ndoubt--the temptation of Doubt.  How he hated it, and stormed at it\nfuriously!  \"Of course they are capable,\" he cried; \"of course they can\nlearn and strive and achieve--\" and \"Of course,\" added the temptation\nsoftly, \"they do nothing of the sort.\"  Of all the three temptations,\nthis one struck the deepest.  Hate?  He had outgrown so childish a\nthing.  Despair?  He had steeled his right arm against it, and fought\nit with the vigor of determination.  But to doubt the worth of his\nlife-work,--to doubt the destiny and capability of the race his soul\nloved because it was his; to find listless squalor instead of eager\nendeavor; to hear his own lips whispering, \"They do not care; they\ncannot</p>",
  "page-384": "<p class=\"no-indent\">know; they are dumb driven cattle,--why cast your pearls before\nswine?\"--this, this seemed more than man could bear; and he closed the\ndoor, and sank upon the steps of the chancel, and cast his robe upon\nthe floor and writhed.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The evening sunbeams had set the dust to dancing in the gloomy chapel\nwhen he arose.  He folded his vestments, put away the hymn-books, and\nclosed the great Bible.  He stepped out into the twilight, looked back\nupon the narrow little pulpit with a weary smile, and locked the door.\nThen he walked briskly to the Bishop, and told the Bishop what the\nBishop already knew.  \"I have failed,\" he said simply.  And gaining\ncourage by the confession, he added: \"What I need is a larger\nconstituency.  There are comparatively few Negroes here, and perhaps\nthey are not of the best.  I must go where the field is wider, and try\nagain.\"  So the Bishop sent him to Philadelphia, with a letter to\nBishop</p>",
  "page-385": "<p class=\"no-indent\">Onderdonk.</p><p>Bishop Onderdonk lived at the head of six white steps,--corpulent,\nred-faced, and the author of several thrilling tracts on Apostolic\nSuccession.  It was after dinner, and the Bishop had settled himself\nfor a pleasant season of contemplation, when the bell must needs ring,\nand there must burst in upon the Bishop a letter and a thin, ungainly\nNegro.  Bishop Onderdonk read the letter hastily and frowned.\nFortunately, his mind was already clear on this point; and he cleared\nhis brow and looked at Crummell.  Then he said, slowly and\nimpressively: \"I will receive you into this diocese on one condition:\nno Negro priest can sit in my church convention, and no Negro church\nmust ask for representation there.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">I sometimes fancy I can see that tableau: the frail black figure,\nnervously twitching his hat before the massive abdomen of Bishop\nOnderdonk; his threadbare</p>",
  "page-386": "<p class=\"no-indent\">coat thrown against the dark woodwork of the\nbookcases, where Fox's \"Lives of the Martyrs\" nestled happily beside\n\"The Whole Duty of Man.\"  I seem to see the wide eyes of the Negro\nwander past the Bishop's broadcloth to where the swinging glass doors\nof the cabinet glow in the sunlight.  A little blue fly is trying to\ncross the yawning keyhole.  He marches briskly up to it, peers into the\nchasm in a surprised sort of way, and rubs his feelers reflectively;\nthen he essays its depths, and, finding it bottomless, draws back\nagain.  The dark-faced priest finds himself wondering if the fly too\nhas faced its Valley of Humiliation, and if it will plunge into\nit,--when lo! it spreads its tiny wings and buzzes merrily across,\nleaving the watcher wingless and alone.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Then the full weight of his burden fell upon him.  The rich walls\nwheeled away, and before him lay the cold rough moor winding on through\nlife, cut in twain by one thick granite ridge,--here, the Valley</p>",
  "page-387": "<p class=\"no-indent\">of\nHumiliation; yonder, the Valley of the Shadow of Death.  And I know not\nwhich be darker,--no, not I. But this I know: in yonder Vale of the\nHumble stand to-day a million swarthy men, who willingly would</p><p>  \". . . bear the whips and scorns of time,\n  The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\n  The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\n  The insolence of office, and the spurns\n  That patient merit of the unworthy takes,\"--</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">all this and more would they bear did they but know that this were\nsacrifice and not a meaner thing.  So surged the thought within that\nlone black breast.  The Bishop cleared his throat suggestively; then,\nrecollecting that there was really nothing to say, considerately said\nnothing, only sat tapping his foot impatiently.  But Alexander Crummell\nsaid, slowly and heavily: \"I will never enter your diocese on such\nterms.\"  And saying this, he turned and passed into the Valley of the\nShadow</p>",
  "page-388": "<p class=\"no-indent\">of Death.  You might have noted only the physical dying, the\nshattered frame and hacking cough; but in that soul lay deeper death\nthan that.  He found a chapel in New York,--the church of his father;\nhe labored for it in poverty and starvation, scorned by his fellow\npriests.  Half in despair, he wandered across the sea, a beggar with\noutstretched hands.  Englishmen clasped them,--Wilberforce and Stanley,\nThirwell and Ingles, and even Froude and Macaulay; Sir Benjamin Brodie\nbade him rest awhile at Queen's College in Cambridge, and there he\nlingered, struggling for health of body and mind, until he took his\ndegree in '53.  Restless still, and unsatisfied, he turned toward\nAfrica, and for long years, amid the spawn of the slave-smugglers,\nsought a new heaven and a new earth.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">So the man groped for light; all this was not Life,--it was the\nworld-wandering of a soul in search of itself, the striving of one who\nvainly sought his place in the world,</p>",
  "page-389": "<p class=\"no-indent\">ever haunted by the shadow of a\ndeath that is more than death,--the passing of a soul that has missed\nits duty.  Twenty years he wandered,--twenty years and more; and yet\nthe hard rasping question kept gnawing within him, \"What, in God's\nname, am I on earth for?\"  In the narrow New York parish his soul\nseemed cramped and smothered.  In the fine old air of the English\nUniversity he heard the millions wailing over the sea.  In the wild\nfever-cursed swamps of West Africa he stood helpless and alone.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">You will not wonder at his weird pilgrimage,--you who in the swift\nwhirl of living, amid its cold paradox and marvellous vision, have\nfronted life and asked its riddle face to face.  And if you find that\nriddle hard to read, remember that yonder black boy finds it just a\nlittle harder; if it is difficult for you to find and face your duty,\nit is a shade more difficult for him; if your heart sickens in the\nblood and dust of battle, remember</p>",
  "page-390": "<p class=\"no-indent\">that to him the dust is thicker and\nthe battle fiercer.  No wonder the wanderers fall!

Out of the temptation of Hate,\nand burned by the fire of Despair, triumphant over Doubt, and steeled\nby Sacrifice against Humiliation, he turned at last home across the\nwaters, humble and strong, gentle and determined.  He bent to all the\ngibes and prejudices, to all hatred and discrimination, with that rare\ncourtesy which is the armor of pure souls.  He fought among his own,\nthe low, the grasping, and the wicked, with that unbending\nrighteousness which is the sword of the just.  He never faltered, he\nseldom complained; he simply worked, inspiring the young, rebuking the\nold, helping the weak,</p>",

And now\nthat he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose\ndear memory I bring this little tribute.  I can see his face still,\ndark and heavy-lined beneath his snowy hair; lighting and shading, now\nwith inspiration for the future, now in innocent pain at some human\nwickedness, now with sorrow at some hard memory from the past.  The\nmore I met Alexander Crummell, the more I felt how much that world was\nlosing which knew so little of him.

But they\nshook their heads when his mother wanted to send him off to school.\n\"It'll spoil him,--ruin him,\" they said; and they talked as though they\nknew.  But full half the black folk followed him proudly to the\nstation, and carried his queer little trunk and many bundles.  And\nthere they shook and shook hands, and the girls kissed him shyly and\nthe boys clapped him on the back.

And so it drifted to\nthe next summer, and the next,--till playmates scattered, and mother\ngrew gray, and sister went up to the Judge's kitchen to work.  And\nstill the legend lingered,--\"When John comes.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Up at the Judge's they rather liked this refrain; for they too had a\nJohn--a fair-haired, smooth-faced boy, who had played many a long\nsummer's day to its close with his darker namesake.  \"Yes, sir!  John\nis at Princeton, sir,\" said the broad-shouldered gray-haired Judge\nevery morning as he marched down to the post-office.  \"Showing the\nYankees what a Southern gentleman can do,\" he added; and strode home\nagain with his letters and papers.  Up at the great pillared house they\nlingered long over the Princeton letter,--the Judge and his frail wife,\nhis sister and growing daughters.  \"It'll make a man of him,\" said the\nJudge, \"college is the place.\"  And then he asked the shy little\nwaitress, \"Well, Jennie, how's your</p>",
  "page-400": "<p class=\"no-indent\">John?\" and added reflectively, \"Too\nbad, too bad your mother sent him off--it will spoil him.\"  And the\nwaitress wondered.</p><p>Thus in the far-away Southern village the world lay waiting, half\nconsciously, the coming of two young men, and dreamed in an\ninarticulate way of new things that would be done and new thoughts that\nall would think.  And yet it was singular that few thought of two\nJohns,--for the black folk thought of one John, and he was black; and\nthe white folk thought of another John, and he was white.  And neither\nworld thought the other world's thought, save with a vague unrest.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Up in Johnstown, at the Institute, we were long puzzled at the case of\nJohn Jones.  For a long time the clay seemed unfit for any sort of\nmoulding.  He was loud and boisterous, always laughing and singing, and\nnever able to work consecutively at anything.  He did not know how to\nstudy; he had no idea of</p>",
  "page-401": "<p class=\"no-indent\">thoroughness; and with his tardiness,\ncarelessness, and appalling good-humor, we were sore perplexed.  One\nnight we sat in faculty-meeting, worried and serious; for Jones was in\ntrouble again.  This last escapade was too much, and so we solemnly\nvoted \"that Jones, on account of repeated disorder and inattention to\nwork, be suspended for the rest of the term.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It seemed to us that the first time life ever struck Jones as a really\nserious thing was when the Dean told him he must leave school.  He\nstared at the gray-haired man blankly, with great eyes.  \"Why,--why,\"\nhe faltered, \"but--I haven't graduated!\"  Then the Dean slowly and\nclearly explained, reminding him of the tardiness and the carelessness,\nof the poor lessons and neglected work, of the noise and disorder,\nuntil the fellow hung his head in confusion.  Then he said quickly,\n\"But you won't tell mammy and sister,--you won't write mammy, now will\nyou?  For if you won't I'll go out into the city and work,</p>",
  "page-402": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and come\nback next term and show you something.\"  So the Dean promised\nfaithfully, and John shouldered his little trunk, giving neither word\nnor look to the giggling boys, and walked down Carlisle Street to the\ngreat city, with sober eyes and a set and serious face.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Perhaps we imagined it, but someway it seemed to us that the serious\nlook that crept over his boyish face that afternoon never left it\nagain.  When he came back to us he went to work with all his rugged\nstrength.  It was a hard struggle, for things did not come easily to\nhim,--few crowding memories of early life and teaching came to help him\non his new way; but all the world toward which he strove was of his own\nbuilding, and he builded slow and hard.  As the light dawned\nlingeringly on his new creations, he sat rapt and silent before the\nvision, or wandered alone over the green campus peering through and\nbeyond the world of men into a world of thought.  And the thoughts at\ntimes puzzled him sorely; he could</p>",
  "page-403": "<p class=\"no-indent\">not see just why the circle was not\nsquare, and carried it out fifty-six decimal places one\nmidnight,--would have gone further, indeed, had not the matron rapped\nfor lights out.  He caught terrible colds lying on his back in the\nmeadows of nights, trying to think out the solar system; he had grave\ndoubts as to the ethics of the Fall of Rome, and strongly suspected the\nGermans of being thieves and rascals, despite his textbooks; he\npondered long over every new Greek word, and wondered why this meant\nthat and why it couldn't mean something else, and how it must have felt\nto think all things in Greek.  So he thought and puzzled along for\nhimself,--pausing perplexed where others skipped merrily, and walking\nsteadily through the difficulties where the rest stopped and\nsurrendered.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Thus he grew in body and soul, and with him his clothes seemed to grow\nand arrange themselves; coat sleeves got longer, cuffs appeared, and\ncollars got less</p>",
  "page-404": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">soiled.  Now and then his boots shone, and a new\ndignity crept into his walk.  And we who saw daily a new thoughtfulness\ngrowing in his eyes began to expect something of this plodding boy.\nThus he passed out of the preparatory school into college, and we who\nwatched him felt four more years of change, which almost transformed\nthe tall, grave man who bowed to us commencement morning.  He had left\nhis queer thought-world and come back to a world of motion and of men.\nHe looked now for the first time sharply about him, and wondered he had\nseen so little before.  He grew slowly to feel almost for the first\ntime the Veil that lay between him and the white world; he first\nnoticed now the oppression that had not seemed oppression before,\ndifferences that erstwhile seemed natural, restraints and slights that\nin his boyhood days had gone unnoticed or been greeted with a laugh.\nHe felt angry now when men did not call him \"Mister,\" he clenched his\nhands at the</p>",
  "page-405": "<p class=\"no-indent\">\"Jim Crow\" cars, and chafed at the color-line that hemmed\nin him and his.  A tinge of sarcasm crept into his speech, and a vague\nbitterness into his life; and he sat long hours wondering and planning\na way around these crooked things.  Daily he found himself shrinking\nfrom the choked and narrow life of his native town.  And yet he always\nplanned to go back to Altamaha,--always planned to work there.  Still,\nmore and more as the day approached he hesitated with a nameless dread;\nand even the day after graduation he seized with eagerness the offer of\nthe Dean to send him North with the quartette during the summer\nvacation, to sing for the Institute.  A breath of air before the\nplunge, he said to himself in half apology.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It was a bright September afternoon, and the streets of New York were\nbrilliant with moving men.  They reminded John of the sea, as he sat in\nthe square and watched them, so changelessly changing, so bright</p>",
  "page-406": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and\ndark, so grave and gay.  He scanned their rich and faultless clothes,\nthe way they carried their hands, the shape of their hats; he peered\ninto the hurrying carriages.  Then, leaning back with a sigh, he said,\n\"This is the World.\"  The notion suddenly seized him to see where the\nworld was going; since many of the richer and brighter seemed hurrying\nall one way.  So when a tall, light-haired young man and a little\ntalkative lady came by, he rose half hesitatingly and followed them.\nUp the street they went, past stores and gay shops, across a broad\nsquare, until with a hundred others they entered the high portal of a\ngreat building.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">He was pushed toward the ticket-office with the others, and felt in his\npocket for the new five-dollar bill he had hoarded.  There seemed\nreally no time for hesitation, so he drew it bravely out, passed it to\nthe busy clerk, and received simply a ticket but no change.  When at\nlast he realized that he had paid five dollars to</p>",
  "page-407": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">enter he knew not\nwhat, he stood stockstill amazed.  \"Be careful,\" said a low voice\nbehind him; \"you must not lynch the colored gentleman simply because\nhe's in your way,\" and a girl looked up roguishly into the eyes of her\nfair-haired escort.  A shade of annoyance passed over the escort's\nface.  \"You WILL not understand us at the South,\" he said half\nimpatiently, as if continuing an argument.  \"With all your professions,\none never sees in the North so cordial and intimate relations between\nwhite and black as are everyday occurrences with us.  Why, I remember\nmy closest playfellow in boyhood was a little Negro named after me, and\nsurely no two,--WELL!\" The man stopped short and flushed to the roots\nof his hair, for there directly beside his reserved orchestra chairs\nsat the Negro he had stumbled over in the hallway.  He hesitated and\ngrew pale with anger, called the usher and gave him his card, with a\nfew peremptory words, and slowly sat down.  The lady</p>",
  "page-408": "<p class=\"no-indent\">deftly changed the\nsubject.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">All this John did not see, for he sat in a half-daze minding the scene\nabout him; the delicate beauty of the hall, the faint perfume, the\nmoving myriad of men, the rich clothing and low hum of talking seemed\nall a part of a world so different from his, so strangely more\nbeautiful than anything he had known, that he sat in dreamland, and\nstarted when, after a hush, rose high and clear the music of\nLohengrin's swan.  The infinite beauty of the wail lingered and swept\nthrough every muscle of his frame, and put it all a-tune.  He closed\nhis eyes and grasped the elbows of the chair, touching unwittingly the\nlady's arm.  And the lady drew away.  A deep longing swelled in all his\nheart to rise with that clear music out of the dirt and dust of that\nlow life that held him prisoned and befouled.  If he could only live up\nin the free air where birds sang and setting suns had no touch of\nblood!  Who had called him to be the slave</p>",
  "page-409": "<p class=\"no-indent\">and butt of all?  And if he\nhad called, what right had he to call when a world like this lay open\nbefore men?</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Then the movement changed, and fuller, mightier harmony swelled away.\nHe looked thoughtfully across the hall, and wondered why the beautiful\ngray-haired woman looked so listless, and what the little man could be\nwhispering about.  He would not like to be listless and idle, he\nthought, for he felt with the music the movement of power within him.\nIf he but had some master-work, some life-service, hard,--aye, bitter\nhard, but without the cringing and sickening servility, without the\ncruel hurt that hardened his heart and soul.  When at last a soft\nsorrow crept across the violins, there came to him the vision of a\nfar-off home, the great eyes of his sister, and the dark drawn face of\nhis mother.  And his heart sank below the waters, even as the sea-sand\nsinks by the shores of Altamaha, only to be lifted aloft again with\nthat last ethereal wail of the swan that</p>",
  "page-410": "<p class=\"no-indent\">quivered and faded away into\nthe sky.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It left John sitting so silent and rapt that he did not for some time\nnotice the usher tapping him lightly on the shoulder and saying\npolitely, \"Will you step this way, please, sir?\"  A little surprised,\nhe arose quickly at the last tap, and, turning to leave his seat,\nlooked full into the face of the fair-haired young man.  For the first\ntime the young man recognized his dark boyhood playmate, and John knew\nthat it was the Judge's son.  The White John started, lifted his hand,\nand then froze into his chair; the black John smiled lightly, then\ngrimly, and followed the usher down the aisle.  The manager was sorry,\nvery, very sorry,--but he explained that some mistake had been made in\nselling the gentleman a seat already disposed of; he would refund the\nmoney, of course,--and indeed felt the matter keenly, and so forth,\nand--before he had finished John was gone, walking hurriedly across the\nsquare and down the broad streets, and as he passed the</p>",
  "page-411": "<p class=\"no-indent\">park he\nbuttoned his coat and said, \"John Jones, you're a natural-born fool.\"\nThen he went to his lodgings and wrote a letter, and tore it up; he\nwrote another, and threw it in the fire.  Then he seized a scrap of\npaper and wrote: \"Dear Mother and Sister--I am coming--John.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps,\" said John, as he settled himself on the train, \"perhaps I am\nto blame myself in struggling against my manifest destiny simply\nbecause it looks hard and unpleasant.  Here is my duty to Altamaha\nplain before me; perhaps they'll let me help settle the Negro problems\nthere,--perhaps they won't.  'I will go in to the King, which is not\naccording to the law; and if I perish, I perish.'\" And then he mused\nand dreamed, and planned a life-work; and the train flew south.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Down in Altamaha, after seven long years, all the world knew John was\ncoming.  The homes were scrubbed and scoured,--above all, one; the\ngardens and yards had an unwonted trimness, and Jennie bought a</p>",
  "page-412": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">new\ngingham.  With some finesse and negotiation, all the dark Methodists\nand Presbyterians were induced to join in a monster welcome at the\nBaptist Church; and as the day drew near, warm discussions arose on\nevery corner as to the exact extent and nature of John's\naccomplishments.  It was noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he\ncame.  The black town flocked to the depot, with a little of the white\nat the edges,--a happy throng, with \"Good-mawnings\" and \"Howdys\" and\nlaughing and joking and jostling.  Mother sat yonder in the window\nwatching; but sister Jennie stood on the platform, nervously fingering\nher dress, tall and lithe, with soft brown skin and loving eyes peering\nfrom out a tangled wilderness of hair.  John rose gloomily as the train\nstopped, for he was thinking of the \"Jim Crow\" car; he stepped to the\nplatform, and paused: a little dingy station, a black crowd gaudy and\ndirty, a half-mile of dilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of\nmud. </p>",
  "page-413": "<p class=\"no-indent\">An overwhelming sense of the sordidness and narrowness of it all\nseized him; he looked in vain for his mother, kissed coldly the tall,\nstrange girl who called him brother, spoke a short, dry word here and\nthere; then, lingering neither for handshaking nor gossip, started\nsilently up the street, raising his hat merely to the last eager old\naunty, to her open-mouthed astonishment.  The people were distinctly\nbewildered.  This silent, cold man,--was this John?  Where was his\nsmile and hearty hand-grasp?  \"'Peared kind o' down in the mouf,\" said\nthe Methodist preacher thoughtfully.  \"Seemed monstus stuck up,\"\ncomplained a Baptist sister.  But the white postmaster from the edge of\nthe crowd expressed the opinion of his folks plainly.  \"That damn\nNigger,\" said he, as he shouldered the mail and arranged his tobacco,\n\"has gone North and got plum full o' fool notions; but they won't work\nin Altamaha.\"  And the crowd melted away.</p>",
  "page-414": "<p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The meeting of welcome at the Baptist Church was a failure.  Rain\nspoiled the barbecue, and thunder turned the milk in the ice-cream.\nWhen the speaking came at night, the house was crowded to overflowing.\nThe three preachers had especially prepared themselves, but somehow\nJohn's manner seemed to throw a blanket over everything,--he seemed so\ncold and preoccupied, and had so strange an air of restraint that the\nMethodist brother could not warm up to his theme and elicited not a\nsingle \"Amen\"; the Presbyterian prayer was but feebly responded to, and\neven the Baptist preacher, though he wakened faint enthusiasm, got so\nmixed up in his favorite sentence that he had to close it by stopping\nfully fifteen minutes sooner than he meant.  The people moved uneasily\nin their seats as John rose to reply.  He spoke slowly and\nmethodically.  The age, he said, demanded new ideas; we were far\ndifferent from those men of the seventeenth and</p>",
  "page-415": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">eighteenth\ncenturies,--with broader ideas of human brotherhood and destiny.  Then\nhe spoke of the rise of charity and popular education, and particularly\nof the spread of wealth and work.  The question was, then, he added\nreflectively, looking at the low discolored ceiling, what part the\nNegroes of this land would take in the striving of the new century.  He\nsketched in vague outline the new Industrial School that might rise\namong these pines, he spoke in detail of the charitable and\nphilanthropic work that might be organized, of money that might be\nsaved for banks and business.  Finally he urged unity, and deprecated\nespecially religious and denominational bickering.  \"To-day,\" he said,\nwith a smile, \"the world cares little whether a man be Baptist or\nMethodist, or indeed a churchman at all, so long as he is good and\ntrue.  What difference does it make whether a man be baptized in river\nor washbowl, or not at all?  Let's leave all that littleness, and</p>",
  "page-416": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">look\nhigher.\"  Then, thinking of nothing else, he slowly sat down.  A\npainful hush seized that crowded mass.  Little had they understood of\nwhat he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue, save the last word about\nbaptism; that they knew, and they sat very still while the clock\nticked.  Then at last a low suppressed snarl came from the Amen corner,\nand an old bent man arose, walked over the seats, and climbed straight\nup into the pulpit.  He was wrinkled and black, with scant gray and\ntufted hair; his voice and hands shook as with palsy; but on his face\nlay the intense rapt look of the religious fanatic.  He seized the\nBible with his rough, huge hands; twice he raised it inarticulate, and\nthen fairly burst into words, with rude and awful eloquence.  He\nquivered, swayed, and bent; then rose aloft in perfect majesty, till\nthe people moaned and wept, wailed and shouted, and a wild shrieking\narose from the corners where all the pent-up feeling of the hour\ngathered itself and rushed</p>",
  "page-417": "<p class=\"no-indent\">into the air.  John never knew clearly what\nthe old man said; he only felt himself held up to scorn and scathing\ndenunciation for trampling on the true Religion, and he realized with\namazement that all unknowingly he had put rough, rude hands on\nsomething this little world held sacred.  He arose silently, and passed\nout into the night.  Down toward the sea he went, in the fitful\nstarlight, half conscious of the girl who followed timidly after him.\nWhen at last he stood upon the bluff, he turned to his little sister\nand looked upon her sorrowfully, remembering with sudden pain how\nlittle thought he had given her.  He put his arm about her and let her\npassion of tears spend itself on his shoulder.</p><p>Long they stood together, peering over the gray unresting water.</p><p>\"John,\" she said, \"does it make every one--unhappy when they study and\nlearn lots of things?\"</p><p>He paused and smiled.  \"I am afraid it does,\" he said.</p>",
  "page-418": "<p>\"And, John, are you glad you studied?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" came the answer, slowly but positively.</p><p>She watched the flickering lights upon the sea, and said thoughtfully,\n\"I wish I was unhappy,--and--and,\" putting both arms about his neck, \"I\nthink I am, a little, John.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It was several days later that John walked up to the Judge's house to\nask for the privilege of teaching the Negro school.  The Judge himself\nmet him at the front door, stared a little hard at him, and said\nbrusquely, \"Go 'round to the kitchen door, John, and wait.\"  Sitting on\nthe kitchen steps, John stared at the corn, thoroughly perplexed.  What\non earth had come over him?  Every step he made offended some one.  He\nhad come to save his people, and before he left the depot he had hurt\nthem.  He sought to teach them at the church, and had outraged their\ndeepest feelings.  He had schooled himself to be respectful to the\nJudge, and then</p>",
  "page-419": "<p class=\"no-indent\">blundered into his front door.  And all the time he had\nmeant right,--and yet, and yet, somehow he found it so hard and strange\nto fit his old surroundings again, to find his place in the world about\nhim.  He could not remember that he used to have any difficulty in the\npast, when life was glad and gay.  The world seemed smooth and easy\nthen.  Perhaps,--but his sister came to the kitchen door just then and\nsaid the Judge awaited him.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The Judge sat in the dining-room amid his morning's mail, and he did\nnot ask John to sit down.  He plunged squarely into the business.\n\"You've come for the school, I suppose.  Well John, I want to speak to\nyou plainly.  You know I'm a friend to your people.  I've helped you\nand your family, and would have done more if you hadn't got the notion\nof going off.  Now I like the colored people, and sympathize with all\ntheir reasonable aspirations; but you and I both know, John, that in\nthis</p>",
  "page-420": "<p class=\"no-indent\">country the Negro must remain subordinate, and can never expect to\nbe the equal of white men.  In their place, your people can be honest\nand respectful; and God knows, I'll do what I can to help them.  But\nwhen they want to reverse nature, and rule white men, and marry white\nwomen, and sit in my parlor, then, by God! we'll hold them under if we\nhave to lynch every Nigger in the land.  Now, John, the question is,\nare you, with your education and Northern notions, going to accept the\nsituation and teach the darkies to be faithful servants and laborers as\nyour fathers were,--I knew your father, John, he belonged to my\nbrother, and he was a good Nigger.  Well--well, are you going to be\nlike him, or are you going to try to put fool ideas of rising and\nequality into these folks' heads, and make them discontented and\nunhappy?\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">\"I am going to accept the situation, Judge Henderson,\" answered John,\nwith a brevity that did not</p>",
  "page-421": "<p class=\"no-indent\">escape the keen old man.  He hesitated a\nmoment, and then said shortly, \"Very well,--we'll try you awhile.\nGood-morning.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">It was a full month after the opening of the Negro school that the\nother John came home, tall, gay, and headstrong.  The mother wept, the\nsisters sang.  The whole white town was glad.  A proud man was the\nJudge, and it was a goodly sight to see the two swinging down Main\nStreet together.  And yet all did not go smoothly between them, for the\nyounger man could not and did not veil his contempt for the little\ntown, and plainly had his heart set on New York.  Now the one cherished\nambition of the Judge was to see his son mayor of Altamaha,\nrepresentative to the legislature, and--who could say?--governor of\nGeorgia.

Nevertheless, he struggled hopefully on, and</p>",
  "page-424": "<p class=\"no-indent\">seemed to see at\nlast some glimmering of dawn.  The attendance was larger and the\nchildren were a shade cleaner this week.  Even the booby class in\nreading showed a little comforting progress.  So John settled himself\nwith renewed patience this afternoon.</p><p>\"Now, Mandy,\" he said cheerfully, \"that's better; but you mustn't chop\nyour words up so: 'If--the-man--goes.'

I'll lock the door myself.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Up at the great pillared house the tall young son wandered aimlessly\nabout after his father's abrupt departure.  In the house there was\nlittle to interest him; the books were old and stale, the local\nnewspaper flat, and the women had retired with headaches and sewing.\nHe tried a nap, but it was too warm.  So he sauntered out into the\nfields, complaining disconsolately, \"Good Lord! how long will this\nimprisonment last!\"  He was not a bad fellow,--just a little spoiled\nand self-indulgent, and as headstrong as his proud father.  He seemed a\nyoung man pleasant to look upon, as he sat on the great black stump at\nthe edge of the pines idly swinging his legs and smoking.  \"Why, there\nisn't even a girl worth getting up a respectable flirtation with,\" he\ngrowled.  Just then his eye caught a tall, willowy figure hurrying\ntoward him on the narrow path.  He looked with</p>",
  "page-426": "<p class=\"no-indent\">interest at first, and\nthen burst into a laugh as he said, \"Well, I declare, if it isn't\nJennie, the little brown kitchen-maid!  Why, I never noticed before\nwhat a trim little body she is.  Hello, Jennie!  Why, you haven't\nkissed me since I came home,\" he said gaily.  The young girl stared at\nhim in surprise and confusion,--faltered something inarticulate, and\nattempted to pass.  But a wilful mood had seized the young idler, and\nhe caught at her arm.  Frightened, she slipped by; and half\nmischievously he turned and ran after her through the tall pines.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Yonder, toward the sea, at the end of the path, came John slowly, with\nhis head down.  He had turned wearily homeward from the schoolhouse;\nthen, thinking to shield his mother from the blow, started to meet his\nsister as she came from work and break the news of his dismissal to\nher.  \"I'll go away,\" he said slowly; \"I'll go away and find work, and\nsend for them.  I cannot live</p>",
  "page-427": "<p class=\"no-indent\">here longer.\"  And then the fierce,\nburied anger surged up into his throat.  He waved his arms and hurried\nwildly up the path.</p><p>The great brown sea lay silent.  The air scarce breathed.  The dying\nday bathed the twisted oaks and mighty pines in black and gold.  There\ncame from the wind no warning, not a whisper from the cloudless sky.\nThere was only a black man hurrying on with an ache in his heart,\nseeing neither sun nor sea, but starting as from a dream at the\nfrightened cry that woke the pines, to see his dark sister struggling\nin the arms of a tall and fair-haired man.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">He said not a word, but, seizing a fallen limb, struck him with all the\npent-up hatred of his great black arm, and the body lay white and still\nbeneath the pines, all bathed in sunshine and in blood.  John looked at\nit dreamily, then walked back to the house briskly, and said in a soft\nvoice, \"Mammy, I'm going away--I'm going</p>",
  "page-428": "<p class=\"no-indent\">to be free.\"</p><p>She gazed at him dimly and faltered, \"No'th, honey, is yo' gwine No'th\nagin?\"</p><p>He looked out where the North Star glistened pale above the waters, and\nsaid, \"Yes, mammy, I'm going--North.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Then, without another word, he went out into the narrow lane, up by the\nstraight pines, to the same winding path, and seated himself on the\ngreat black stump, looking at the blood where the body had lain.\nYonder in the gray past he had played with that dead boy, romping\ntogether under the solemn trees.  The night deepened; he thought of the\nboys at Johnstown.  He wondered how Brown had turned out, and Carey?\nAnd Jones,--Jones?  Why, he was Jones, and he wondered what they would\nall say when they knew, when they knew, in that great long dining-room\nwith its hundreds of merry eyes.  Then as the sheen of the</p>",
  "page-429": "<p class=\"no-indent\">starlight\nstole over him, he thought of the gilded ceiling of that vast concert\nhall, heard stealing toward him the faint sweet music of the swan.\nHark! was it music, or the hurry and shouting of men?  Yes, surely!\nClear and high the faint sweet melody rose and fluttered like a living\nthing, so that the very earth trembled as with the tramp of horses and\nmurmur of angry men.</p><p>He leaned back and smiled toward the sea, whence rose the strange\nmelody, away from the dark shadows where lay the noise of horses\ngalloping, galloping on.  With an effort he roused himself, bent\nforward, and looked steadily down the pathway, softly humming the \"Song\nof the Bride,\"--</p><p>  \"Freudig gefuhrt, ziehet dahin.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Amid the trees in the dim morning twilight he watched their shadows\ndancing and heard their horses thundering toward him, until at last\nthey came sweeping like a storm, and he saw in front that</p>",
  "page-430": "<p class=\"no-indent\">haggard\nwhite-haired man, whose eyes flashed red with fury.  Oh, how he pitied\nhim,--pitied him,--and wondered if he had the coiling twisted rope.\nThen, as the storm burst round him, he rose slowly to his feet and\nturned his closed eyes toward the Sea.</p><p>And the world whistled in his ears.</p>",

And so before each thought that I\nhave written in this book I have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these\nweird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men.\nEver since I was a child these songs have stirred me strangely.  They\ncame out of the South unknown to me, one by one, and yet at once I knew\nthem as of me and of mine.  Then in after years when I came to\nNashville I saw the great temple builded of these songs towering over\nthe pale city.  To me Jubilee Hall seemed ever made</p>",

And so\nby fateful chance the Negro folk-song--the rhythmic cry of the\nslave--stands to-day not simply as the sole American music, but as the\nmost beautiful expression of human experience born this side the seas.\nIt has been neglected, it has been, and is, half despised, and above\nall it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood; but\nnotwithstanding, it still remains as the singular spiritual heritage of\nthe nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people.</p>",
  "page-434": "<p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Away back in the thirties the melody of these slave songs stirred the\nnation, but the songs were soon half forgotten.  Some, like \"Near the\nlake where drooped the willow,\" passed into current airs and their\nsource was forgotten; others were caricatured on the \"minstrel\" stage\nand their memory died away.  Then in war-time came the singular Port\nRoyal experiment after the capture of Hilton Head, and perhaps for the\nfirst time the North met the Southern slave face to face and heart to\nheart with no third witness.  The Sea Islands of the Carolinas, where\nthey met, were filled with a black folk of primitive type, touched and\nmoulded less by the world about them than any others outside the Black\nBelt.  Their appearance was uncouth, their language funny, but their\nhearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.\nThomas Wentworth Higginson hastened to tell of these songs, and Miss\nMcKim and others urged upon the world their rare</p>",
  "page-435": "<p class=\"no-indent\">beauty.  But the world\nlistened only half credulously until the Fisk Jubilee Singers sang the\nslave songs so deeply into the world's heart that it can never wholly\nforget them again.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">There was once a blacksmith's son born at Cadiz, New York, who in the\nchanges of time taught school in Ohio and helped defend Cincinnati from\nKirby Smith.  Then he fought at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg and\nfinally served in the Freedmen's Bureau at Nashville.  Here he formed a\nSunday-school class of black children in 1866, and sang with them and\ntaught them to sing.  And then they taught him to sing, and when once\nthe glory of the Jubilee songs passed into the soul of George L. White,\nhe knew his life-work was to let those Negroes sing to the world as\nthey had sung to him.  So in 1871 the pilgrimage of the Fisk Jubilee\nSingers began.  North to Cincinnati they rode,--four half-clothed black\nboys and five girl-women,--led by a man with a cause and a</p>",
  "page-436": "<p class=\"no-indent\">purpose.\nThey stopped at Wilberforce, the oldest of Negro schools, where a black\nbishop blessed them.  Then they went, fighting cold and starvation,\nshut out of hotels, and cheerfully sneered at, ever northward; and ever\nthe magic of their song kept thrilling hearts, until a burst of\napplause in the Congregational Council at Oberlin revealed them to the\nworld.  They came to New York and Henry Ward Beecher dared to welcome\nthem, even though the metropolitan dailies sneered at his \"Nigger\nMinstrels.\"  So their songs conquered till they sang across the land\nand across the sea, before Queen and Kaiser, in Scotland and Ireland,\nHolland and Switzerland.  Seven years they sang, and brought back a\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars to found Fisk University.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Since their day they have been imitated--sometimes well, by the singers\nof Hampton and Atlanta, sometimes ill, by straggling quartettes.\nCaricature has</p>",
  "page-437": "<p class=\"no-indent\">sought again to spoil the quaint beauty of the music,\nand has filled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears\nscarce know from the real.  But the true Negro folk-song still lives in\nthe hearts of those who have heard them truly sung and in the hearts of\nthe Negro people.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">What are these songs, and what do they mean?  I know little of music\nand can say nothing in technical phrase, but I know something of men,\nand knowing them, I know that these songs are the articulate message of\nthe slave to the world.  They tell us in these eager days that life was\njoyous to the black slave, careless and happy.  I can easily believe\nthis of some, of many.  But not all the past South, though it rose from\nthe dead, can gainsay the heart-touching witness of these songs.  They\nare the music of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment;\nthey tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer\nworld, of misty</p>",
  "page-438": "<p class=\"no-indent\">wanderings and hidden ways.</p><p>The songs are indeed the siftings of centuries; the music is far more\nancient than the words, and in it we can trace here and there signs of\ndevelopment.  My grandfather's grandmother was seized by an evil Dutch\ntrader two centuries ago; and coming to the valleys of the Hudson and\nHousatonic, black, little, and lithe, she shivered and shrank in the\nharsh north winds, looked longingly at the hills, and often crooned a\nheathen melody to the child between her knees, thus:</p><p>  Do ba-na co-ba, ge-ne me, ge-ne me!\n  Do ba-na co-ba, ge-ne me, ge-ne me!\n  Ben d' nu-li, nu-li, nu-li, ben d' le.</p><p>The child sang it to his children and they to their children's\nchildren, and so two hundred years it has travelled down to us and we\nsing it to our children, knowing as little as our fathers what its\nwords may mean, but knowing well the meaning of its music.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">This was primitive African music; it may be seen in</p>",

One of these I have just\nmentioned.  Another whose strains begin this book is \"Nobody knows the\ntrouble I've seen.\"  When, struck with a sudden poverty, the United\nStates refused to fulfill its promises of land to the freedmen, a\nbrigadier-general went down to the Sea Islands to carry the news.  An\nold woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this song; all\nthe mass joined with her, swaying.  And the soldier wept.</p>",
  "page-440": "<p>The third song is the cradle-song of death which all men know,-\"Swing\nlow, sweet chariot,\"--whose bars begin the life story of \"Alexander\nCrummell.\"  Then there is the song of many waters, \"Roll, Jordan,\nroll,\" a mighty chorus with minor cadences.  There were many songs of\nthe fugitive like that which opens \"The Wings of Atalanta,\" and the\nmore familiar \"Been a-listening.\"  The seventh is the song of the End\nand the Beginning--\"My Lord, what a mourning! when the stars begin to\nfall\"; a strain of this is placed before \"The Dawn of Freedom.\"  The\nsong of groping--\"My way's cloudy\"--begins \"The Meaning of Progress\";\nthe ninth is the song of this chapter--\"Wrestlin' Jacob, the day is\na-breaking,\"--a paean of hopeful strife.  The last master song is the\nsong of songs--\"Steal away,\"--sprung from \"The Faith of the Fathers.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">There are many others of the Negro folk-songs as striking and\ncharacteristic as these, as, for instance, the</p>",
  "page-441": "<p class=\"no-indent\">three strains in the\nthird, eighth, and ninth chapters; and others I am sure could easily\nmake a selection on more scientific principles.  There are, too, songs\nthat seem to be a step removed from the more primitive types: there is\nthe maze-like medley, \"Bright sparkles,\" one phrase of which heads \"The\nBlack Belt\"; the Easter carol, \"Dust, dust and ashes\"; the dirge, \"My\nmother's took her flight and gone home\"; and that burst of melody\nhovering over \"The Passing of the First-Born\"--\"I hope my mother will\nbe there in that beautiful world on high.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">These represent a third step in the development of the slave song, of\nwhich \"You may bury me in the East\" is the first, and songs like \"March\non\" (chapter six) and \"Steal away\" are the second.  The first is\nAfrican music, the second Afro-American, while the third is a blending\nof Negro music with the music heard in the foster land.  The result is\nstill distinctively Negro and the method of</p>",
  "page-442": "<p class=\"no-indent\">blending original, but the\nelements are both Negro and Caucasian.  One might go further and find a\nfourth step in this development, where the songs of white America have\nbeen distinctively influenced by the slave songs or have incorporated\nwhole phrases of Negro melody, as \"Swanee River\" and \"Old Black Joe.\"\nSide by side, too, with the growth has gone the debasements and\nimitations--the Negro \"minstrel\" songs, many of the \"gospel\" hymns, and\nsome of the contemporary \"coon\" songs,--a mass of music in which the\nnovice may easily lose himself and never find the real Negro melodies.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">In these songs, I have said, the slave spoke to the world.  Such a\nmessage is naturally veiled and half articulate.  Words and music have\nlost each other and new and cant phrases of a dimly understood theology\nhave displaced the older sentiment.  Once in a while we catch a strange\nword of an unknown tongue, as the \"Mighty Myo,\" which figures as a\nriver of death; more</p>",
  "page-443": "<p class=\"no-indent\">often slight words or mere doggerel are joined to\nmusic of singular sweetness.  Purely secular songs are few in number,\npartly because many of them were turned into hymns by a change of\nwords, partly because the frolics were seldom heard by the stranger,\nand the music less often caught.  Of nearly all the songs, however, the\nmusic is distinctly sorrowful.  The ten master songs I have mentioned\ntell in word and music of trouble and exile, of strife and hiding; they\ngrope toward some unseen power and sigh for rest in the End.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The words that are left to us are not without interest, and, cleared of\nevident dross, they conceal much of real poetry and meaning beneath\nconventional theology and unmeaning rhapsody.

The sudden wild thunderstorms of the South awed\nand impressed the Negroes,--at times the rumbling seemed to them\n\"mournful,\" at times imperious:</p><p>  \"My Lord calls me,\n  He calls me by the thunder,\n  The trumpet sounds it in my soul.\"</p><p>The monotonous toil and exposure is painted in many words.  One sees\nthe ploughmen in the hot, moist furrow, singing:</p><p>  \"Dere's no rain to wet you,\n   Dere's no sun to burn you,\n   Oh, push along, believer,\n   I want to go home.\"</p><p>The bowed and bent old man cries, with thrice-repeated wail:</p><p>  \"O Lord, keep me from sinking down,\"</p><p>and he rebukes the devil of doubt who can whisper:</p><p>  \"Jesus is dead and God's gone away.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Yet the soul-hunger is there, the restlessness of the</p>",
  "page-445": "<p class=\"no-indent\">savage, the wail\nof the wanderer, and the plaint is put in one little phrase:</p><p>  My soul wants something that's new, that's new</p><p>Over the inner thoughts of the slaves and their relations one with\nanother the shadow of fear ever hung, so that we get but glimpses here\nand there, and also with them, eloquent omissions and silences.  Mother\nand child are sung, but seldom father; fugitive and weary wanderer call\nfor pity and affection, but there is little of wooing and wedding; the\nrocks and the mountains are well known, but home is unknown.  Strange\nblending of love and helplessness sings through the refrain:</p><p>  \"Yonder's my ole mudder,\n   Been waggin' at de hill so long;\n  'Bout time she cross over,\n   Git home bime-by.\"</p><p>Elsewhere comes the cry of the \"motherless\" and the \"Farewell,\nfarewell, my only child.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Love-songs are scarce and fall into two</p>",
  "page-446": "<p class=\"no-indent\">categories--the frivolous and\nlight, and the sad.  Of deep successful love there is ominous silence,\nand in one of the oldest of these songs there is a depth of history and\nmeaning:</p><p>  Poor Ro-sy, poor gal; Poor Ro-sy,\n  poor gal; Ro-sy break my poor heart,\n  Heav'n shall-a-be my home.</p><p>A black woman said of the song, \"It can't be sung without a full heart\nand a troubled sperrit.\"  The same voice sings here that sings in the\nGerman folk-song:</p><p>Of death the Negro showed little fear, but talked of it familiarly and\neven fondly as simply a crossing of the waters, perhaps--who\nknows?--back to his ancient forests again.  Later days transfigured his\nfatalism, and amid the dust and dirt the toiler sang:</p><p>  \"Dust, dust and ashes, fly over my grave,\n   But the Lord shall bear my spirit home.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">The things evidently borrowed from the surrounding world undergo\ncharacteristic change when</p>",
  "page-447": "<p class=\"no-indent\">they enter the mouth of the slave.\nEspecially is this true of Bible phrases.  \"Weep, O captive daughter of\nZion,\" is quaintly turned into \"Zion, weep-a-low,\" and the wheels of\nEzekiel are turned every way in the mystic dreaming of the slave, till\nhe says:</p><p> \"There's a little wheel a-turnin' in-a-my heart.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">As in olden time, the words of these hymns were improvised by some\nleading minstrel of the religious band.  The circumstances of the\ngathering, however, the rhythm of the songs, and the limitations of\nallowable thought, confined the poetry for the most part to single or\ndouble lines, and they seldom were expanded to quatrains or longer\ntales, although there are some few examples of sustained efforts,\nchiefly paraphrases of the Bible.  Three short series of verses have\nalways attracted me,--the one that heads this chapter, of one line of\nwhich Thomas Wentworth Higginson has fittingly said, \"Never, it seems\nto me, since man first lived and</p>",
  "page-448": "<p class=\"no-indent\">suffered was his infinite longing for\npeace uttered more plaintively.\"  The second and third are descriptions\nof the Last Judgment,--the one a late improvisation, with some traces\nof outside influence:</p><p>  \"Oh, the stars in the elements are falling,\n   And the moon drips away into blood,\n   And the ransomed of the Lord are returning unto God,\n   Blessed be the name of the Lord.\"</p><p>And the other earlier and homelier picture from the low coast lands:</p><p>  \"Michael, haul the boat ashore,\n   Then you'll hear the horn they blow,\n   Then you'll hear the trumpet sound,\n   Trumpet sound the world around,\n   Trumpet sound for rich and poor,\n   Trumpet sound the Jubilee,\n   Trumpet sound for you and me.\"</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">Through all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope--a\nfaith in the ultimate justice of things.

My children, my little children, are\nsinging to the sunshine, and thus they sing:</p><p>  Let us cheer the wea-ry trav-el-ler,\n  Cheer the wea-ry trav-el-ler, Let us\n  cheer the wea-ry trav-el-ler\n  A-long the heav-en-ly way.</p><p class=\"stretch-last-line\">And the traveller girds himself, and sets his face</p>",

Let there spring, Gentle One,\nfrom out its leaves vigor of thought and thoughtful deed to reap the\nharvest wonderful.  Let the ears of a guilty people tingle with truth,\nand seventy millions sigh for the righteousness which exalteth nations,\nin this drear day when human brotherhood is mockery and a snare.  Thus\nin Thy good time may infinite reason turn the tangle straight, and\nthese crooked marks on a fragile leaf be not indeed</p>",
