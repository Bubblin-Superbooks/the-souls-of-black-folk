The Negroes were rent into factions for and against him, the parents were careless, the children irregular and dirty, and books, pencils, and slates largely missing.

So John settled himself with renewed patience this afternoon.</p><p>"Now, Mandy," he said cheerfully, "that's better; but you mustn't chop your words up so: 'If--the-man--goes.' Why, your little brother even wouldn't tell a story that way, now would he?"</p></div> </div>
