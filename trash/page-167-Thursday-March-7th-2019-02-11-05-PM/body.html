<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why not here, and perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time centres of learning and living, colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South a few white men and a few black men of broad culture, catholic tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?</p><p>Patience, Humility, Manners, and Taste, common schools and kindergartens, industrial and technical schools, literature and tolerance,--all these spring from knowledge and culture, the children of the university. So must men and nations build, not otherwise, not upside down.</p><p>Teach workers to work,--a wise saying; wise when applied to German boys and American girls; wiser when said of Negro boys, for they have less knowledge of working and none to teach them.</p></div> </div>
