<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In winter's twilight, when the red sun glows, I can see the dark figures pass between the halls to the music of the night-bell. In the morning, when the sun is golden, the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and laughter of three hundred young hearts from hall and street, and from the busy city below,--children all dark and heavy-haired,--to join their clear young voices in the music of the morning sacrifice. In a half-dozen class-rooms they gather then,--here to follow the love-song of Dido, here to listen to the tale of Troy divine; there to wander among the stars, there to wander among men and nations,--and elsewhere other well-worn ways of knowing this queer world. Nothing new, no time-saving devices,--simply old time-glorified methods of delving for Truth, and searching out the hidden beauties of life, and learning the good of living.</p></div> </div>
