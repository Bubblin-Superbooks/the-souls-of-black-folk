<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The sudden wild thunderstorms of the South awed and impressed the Negroes,--at times the rumbling seemed to them "mournful," at times imperious:</p><p>"My Lord calls me, He calls me by the thunder, The trumpet sounds it in my soul."</p><p>The monotonous toil and exposure is painted in many words. One sees the ploughmen in the hot, moist furrow, singing:</p><p>"Dere's no rain to wet you, Dere's no sun to burn you, Oh, push along, believer, I want to go home."</p><p>The bowed and bent old man cries, with thrice-repeated wail:</p><p>"O Lord, keep me from sinking down,"</p></div> </div>
