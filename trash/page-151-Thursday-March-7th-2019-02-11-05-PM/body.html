<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was no maiden's idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful wilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War,--feudalism, poverty, the rise of the Third Estate, serfdom, the re-birth of Law and Order, and above and between all, the Veil of Race. How heavy a journey for weary feet! what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all this hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red waste of sun-baked clay! How fleet must Atalanta be if she will not be tempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!</p><p>The Sanctuary of our fathers has, to be sure, few Gods,--some sneer, "all too few." There is the thrifty Mercury of New England, Pluto of the North, and Ceres of the West;</p></div> </div>
