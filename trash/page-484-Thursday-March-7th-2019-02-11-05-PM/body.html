An old woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this song; all the mass joined with her, swaying. And the soldier wept.</p><p>The third song is the cradle-song of death which all men know,-"Swing low, sweet chariot,"--whose bars begin the life story of "Alexander Crummell." Then there is the song of many waters, "Roll, Jordan, roll," a mighty chorus with minor cadences. There were many songs of the fugitive like that which opens "The Wings of Atalanta," and the more familiar "Been a-listening." The seventh is the song of the End and the Beginning--"My Lord, what a mourning! when the stars begin to fall"; a strain of this is placed before "The Dawn of Freedom."</p></div> </div>
