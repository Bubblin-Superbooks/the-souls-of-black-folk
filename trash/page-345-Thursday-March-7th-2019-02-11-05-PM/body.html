<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Within and without the sombre veil of color vast social forces have been at work,--efforts for human betterment, movements toward disintegration and despair, tragedies and comedies in social and economic life, and a swaying and lifting and sinking of human hearts which have made this land a land of mingled sorrow and joy, of change and excitement and unrest.</p><p>The centre of this spiritual turmoil has ever been the millions of black freedmen and their sons, whose destiny is so fatefully bound up with that of the nation. And yet the casual observer visiting the South sees at first little of this. He notes the growing frequency of dark faces as he rides along,--but otherwise the days slip lazily on, the sun shines, and this little world seems as happy and contented as other worlds he has visited.</p></div> </div>
