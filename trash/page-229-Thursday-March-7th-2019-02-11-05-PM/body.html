<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of course Harrison Gohagen,--a quiet yellow man, young, smooth-faced, and diligent,--of course he is lord of some hundred acres, and we expect to see a vision of well-kept rooms and fat beds and laughing children. For has he not fine fences? And those over yonder, why should they build fences on the rack-rented land? It will only increase their rent.</p><p>On we wind, through sand and pines and glimpses of old plantations, till there creeps into sight a cluster of buildings,--wood and brick, mills and houses, and scattered cabins. It seemed quite a village. As it came nearer and nearer, however, the aspect changed: the buildings were rotten, the bricks were falling out, the mills were silent, and the store was closed. Only in the cabins appeared now and then a bit of lazy life. I could imagine the place under some weird spell, and was half-minded to search out the princess.</p></div> </div>
