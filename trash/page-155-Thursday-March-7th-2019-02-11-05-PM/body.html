The old leaders of Negro opinion, in the little groups where there is a Negro social consciousness, are being replaced by new; neither the black preacher nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago. Into their places are pushing the farmers and gardeners, the well-paid porters and artisans, the business-men,--all those with property and money. And with all this change, so curiously parallel to that of the Other-world, goes too the same inevitable change in ideals.</p></div> </div>
