<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Below Macon the world grows darker; for now we approach the Black Belt,--that strange land of shadows, at which even slaves paled in the past, and whence come now only faint and half-intelligible murmurs to the world beyond. The "Jim Crow Car" grows larger and a shade better; three rough field-hands and two or three white loafers accompany us, and the newsboy still spreads his wares at one end. The sun is setting, but we can see the great cotton country as we enter it,--the soil now dark and fertile, now thin and gray, with fruit-trees and dilapidated buildings,--all the way to Albany.</p><p>At Albany, in the heart of the Black Belt, we stop. Two hundred miles south of Atlanta, two hundred miles west of the Atlantic, and one hundred miles north of the Great Gulf lies Dougherty County, with ten thousand Negroes and two thousand whites.</p></div> </div>
