I hear now that Voice at midnight calling me from dull and dreamless trance,--crying, "The Shadow of Death! The Shadow of Death!" Out into the starlight I crept, to rouse the gray physician,--the Shadow of Death, the Shadow of Death. The hours trembled on; the night listened; the ghastly dawn glided like a tired thing across the lamplight. Then we two alone looked upon the child as he turned toward us with great eyes, and stretched his stringlike hands,--the Shadow of Death! And we spoke no word, and turned away.</p><p>He died at eventide, when the sun lay like a brooding sorrow above the western hills, veiling its face; when the winds spoke not, and the trees, the great green trees he loved, stood motionless.</p></div> </div>
