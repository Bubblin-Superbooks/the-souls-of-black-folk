<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">savage, the wail
of the wanderer, and the plaint is put in one little phrase:</p><p>  My soul wants something that's new, that's new</p><p>Over the inner thoughts of the slaves and their relations one with
another the shadow of fear ever hung, so that we get but glimpses here
and there, and also with them, eloquent omissions and silences.  Mother
and child are sung, but seldom father; fugitive and weary wanderer call
for pity and affection, but there is little of wooing and wedding; the
rocks and the mountains are well known, but home is unknown.  Strange
blending of love and helplessness sings through the refrain:</p><p>  "Yonder's my ole mudder,
   Been waggin' at de hill so long;
  'Bout time she cross over,
   Git home bime-by."</p><p>Elsewhere comes the cry of the "motherless" and the "Farewell,
farewell, my only child."</p><p class="stretch-last-line">Love-songs are scarce and fall into two</p></div> </div>
