<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Oh, the stars in the elements are falling, And the moon drips away into blood, And the ransomed of the Lord are returning unto God, Blessed be the name of the Lord."</p><p>And the other earlier and homelier picture from the low coast lands:</p><p>"Michael, haul the boat ashore, Then you'll hear the horn they blow, Then you'll hear the trumpet sound, Trumpet sound the world around, Trumpet sound for rich and poor, Trumpet sound the Jubilee, Trumpet sound for you and me."</p><p>Through all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope--a faith in the ultimate justice of things. The minor cadences of despair change often to triumph and calm confidence. Sometimes it is faith in life, sometimes a faith in death, sometimes assurance of boundless justice in some fair world beyond.</p></div> </div>
