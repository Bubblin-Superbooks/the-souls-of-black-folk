his elbows on his knees.  His dark-faced wife sat beside him, stolid,
silent.</p><p>"Hello!" cried my driver,--he has a most imprudent way of addressing
these people, though they seem used to it,--"what have you got there?"</p><p>"Meat and meal," answered the man, stopping.  The meat lay uncovered in
the bottom of the wagon,--a great thin side of fat pork covered with
salt; the meal was in a white bushel bag.</p><p>"What did you pay for that meat?"</p><p>"Ten cents a pound."  It could have been bought for six or seven cents
cash.</p><p>"And the meal?"</p><p>"Two dollars."  One dollar and ten cents is the cash price in town.
Here was a man paying five dollars for goods which he could have bought
for three dollars cash, and raised for one dollar or one dollar and a
half.</p></div> </div>
