<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Rows of old cabins appear filled with renters and laborers,--cheerless, bare, and dirty, for the most part, although here and there the very age and decay makes the scene picturesque. A young black fellow greets us. He is twenty-two, and just married. Until last year he had good luck renting; then cotton fell, and the sheriff seized and sold all he had. So he moved here, where the rent is higher, the land poorer, and the owner inflexible; he rents a forty-dollar mule for twenty dollars a year. Poor lad!--a slave at twenty-two. This plantation, owned now by a foreigner, was a part of the famous Bolton estate. After the war it was for many years worked by gangs of Negro convicts,--and black convicts then were even more plentiful than now; it was a way of making Negroes work, and the question of guilt was a minor one.</p></div> </div>
