<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>  I walk through the churchyard
      To lay this body down;
  I know moon-rise, I know star-rise;

  And my soul and thy soul shall meet that day,
      When I lay this body down.</p><p>  NEGRO SONG.</p><p class="stretch-last-line">They that walked in darkness sang songs in the olden days--Sorrow

the pale city.  To me Jubilee Hall seemed ever made</p></div> </div>
