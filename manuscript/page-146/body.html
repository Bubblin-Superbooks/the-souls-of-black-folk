<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O black boy of Atlanta! But half was spoken; The slave's chains and the master's Alike are broken; The one curse of the races Held both in tether; They are rising--all are rising-- The black and white together.</p><p>WHITTIER.</p><p>South of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred Hills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the future. I have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day had half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia; then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.</p></div> </div>
