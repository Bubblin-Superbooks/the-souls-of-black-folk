strange assembly, where all faces are tinged brown or black, and where

and mingle their waters in seeming carelessness,--then they divide and
flow wide apart.  It is done quietly; no mistakes are made, or if one
occurs, the swift arm of the law and of public opinion swings down for
a moment, as when the other day a black man and a white woman were
arrested for talking together on Whitehall Street in Atlanta.</p><p class="stretch-last-line">Now if one notices carefully one will see that between these two

almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference</p></div> </div>
