<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The South laments to-day the slow, steady disappearance of a certain type of Negro,--the faithful, courteous slave of other days, with his incorruptible honesty and dignified humility. He is passing away just as surely as the old type of Southern gentleman is passing, and from not dissimilar causes,--the sudden transformation of a fair far-off ideal of Freedom into the hard reality of bread-winning and the consequent deification of Bread.</p><p>In the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals of this people--the strife for another and a juster world, the vague dream of righteousness, the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger is that these ideals, with their simple beauty and weird inspiration, will suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold.</p></div> </div>
